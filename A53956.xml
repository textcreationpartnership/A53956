            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Am oblig'd to offer to your Lordſhip theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Papers, which will the rather need a good Patron (ſuch as your Lordſhip) becauſe the Times are Cenſorious, and many miſ-guided peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ready to clamour againſt a man that ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture (though out of pure Charity) to direct them contrary to their own minds. <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved long ago, that Man is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Such a moroſe, querulous and Squeamiſh ſtomach't thing, that he will cry out at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever croſſeth his Humour, whether it be wrong or Right. I do not doubt, but it may be my Lot to receive ſuch Returnes from ſome; and, as to mine own particular, I do not care if it be, eſpecially ſince Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring is again become a Mode. I am ſure, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this little piece is Honeſt; for it aimeth at Peace and unity, which in theſe uncertain and tottering times is the only Expedient to ſecure the intereſt of our Religion againſt a Forreign Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41051:3"/>
Many even of different perſwaſions in other things, are agreed in this. But the great queſtion is, what are the beaſt Means for the compaſſing of ſo Excellent an End? And ſome (to uſe their own Expreſſion) are for ſetting the Church doors wider open<hi>:</hi> meaning, that they would have ſome of our Uſages and Conſtitutions thrown aſide, becauſe they are not fit for their Tooth, unleſs it be to bite at. But were this thing fairly Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, I beleive 'twould be as ineffectual in its iſſue, as 'tis unreaſonable in it ſelf. For how impoſſible is it, to ſatisfie Deſires that are ſtill craving? we could never yet tell (nor can they themſelves) what will really ſtint them; only ſome have told us in general Terms, that they would have every thing down, which is not of Primitive uſe; of which they themſelves muſt be judges too<hi>:</hi> So that if they will pleaſe to conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole frame of our Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, away it muſt, or elſe they will not be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Conceſſions hitherto have been ſo far from being Advantageous to the Church, that (like General In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences) they have only made ungrateful Spirits the more Bold and Inſolent, ſo that they hope at laſt to get into the Saddle. Thoſe five Reverend Divines, who were fain to lay their Noddles together to give birth to <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> among other Huge Reaſons for the Aboliſhing of our Liturgy, urged this for one, becauſe, forſooth, it had already undergone ſome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations. As for inſtance; whereas in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, days of Abſtinence were called Fiſh-days, afterwards that word was altered, and
<pb facs="tcp:41051:3"/>
Faſting days was put in its room. From which Mighty Argument thoſe great Logicians and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Divines did ſtrongly conclude, that the whole Service-book might be laid aſide. Find the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence He that can; but ſad and long Experience hath ſhew'd us, what advantage deſigning and inſatiable Men will take of every little thing, to make it a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and to plead for more ſtill, that after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of this pin and that, and ſo on, the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick may at laſt tumble upon our heads.</p>
            <p>Would to God this deſign was not on foot now, But however ſome endeavour to ſtop our Mouths, yet we have Eyes as well as They, and there is too great Reaſon to conclude, that many (that is to ſay, ſome Atheiſts, ſome Jeſuited perſons, and ſome whoſe low Fortunes and Intereſt (together with their Malice) engage them to be Factious) do directly level their aim at the Ruine of our Eſtabliſh't Church.</p>
            <p>We are ſo charitable as to hope, that many of our Diſſenters are better conditioned. But as in the late Troubles, the Rebellion went further than the firſt Raiſers of it did intend (for they hoped to force the King to buckle to their Terms, when others behind them did reſolve to force Him, and Monarchy, to the Grave) ſo we have grounds to believe, that now while one party deſires an accommodation in ſome matters, others make uſe of their Help and Aſſiſtance, with an intent to overthrow all.</p>
            <p>This unadviſed concurrence of our over zealous Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in this Juncture, though it be of moſt evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb facs="tcp:41051:4"/>
yet is the more to be pittied, becauſe they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently ſtrive againſt their own ſecurities. For it is evident to any indifferent Eye, that the great Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> whoſe Doctrines are a certain Antidote againſt poyſonous Principles from abroad, and whoſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſcipline do tend of themſelves to Order and Unity at home.</p>
            <p>Yet certainly it is want of Judgement and clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the Nature of our Eſtabliſhments, which hath made ſome ſo paſſionately to oppoſe them; becauſe they will not give themſelves the leaſure to read and conſider thoſe Books which all along, have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in defence of them, by learned and good Men, who ſaw of what vaſt uſe they were to the intereſt of the Proteſtant Cauſe. And though I may not expect, that my little pains will be taken notice of (much leſs, prove ſucceſsful) when the labours of ſo many great men have been loſt; yet I had ſome reaſons to induce me to diſcourſe purpoſely of the Antiquity of our uſages; the rather, becauſe a wrong and groundleſs notion runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that all our Conſtitutions were Originally bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of the Romaniſts; ſo that whoſoever now is a ſtrict Conformiſt, is looked upon by the heady rabble to be Popiſhly affected, and ſtands fair to be knockt down, when opportunity ſhall ſerve (which is the main thing wanting.)</p>
            <p>Not to diſſemble with your Lordſhip, I did not long ago, diſcourſe upon this Theme in the Pulpit. And finding the ſubject ſo acceptable (and in a manner a new
<pb facs="tcp:41051:4"/>
thing, even) to intelligent and ſober perſons, I had ſome ſtrong invitations to publiſh thoſe ſhort Collections, which I had then made. But knowing the Niceneſs of the ſubject, and the Capricious humour of ſome men who lie upon the Catch, I found it neceſſary to take all into pieces, and to throw aſide ſome things, and to add many more, and more largely; ſo that my task was like the mending and altering of an old Houſe, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſo troubleſome and chargeable, that a new one may be built at a cheaper rate.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, I hope the world will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me for entitling this (though inconſiderable) Piece to your Patronage. Every Creature would lay its young in a ſecure place; and ſo would I, mine. And though that be enough to excuſe me (in point of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) for ſeeking the beſt ſhelter, yet my obligations to your Lorſhip, do moreover require me (in point of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to expreſs my Gratitude in ſome little meaſure; though I confeſs, 'tis much more eaſie to contract a new debt to your Lordſhip, then to make any tollerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of an old one.</p>
            <p>That God would preſerve your Lordſhip in honor and ſafety, and make your great cares and indeavours ſucceſsful to the good of this poor Church (that is, to your Lordſhips own hearts deſire) as it ought to be the Prayer of every honeſt and ſincere Proteſtant, ſo it is eſpecially of him, who is</p>

            <head>The Good Old Way: OR, <hi>A Diſcourſe offered to the Conſideration of all True-hearted Proteſtants, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SInce theſe <hi>freſh</hi> Confuſions and Diſtractions have broke in upon us, by occaſion whereof this our poor Nation (like a diſtemper'd Body) is all on a <hi>Ferment,</hi> ſeveral <hi>bad humours</hi> ſtriving to be <hi>predominant,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſtifle that which is indeed the <hi>life and ſafety</hi> of the whole; I have often thought upon the dangerous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the <hi>Jews</hi> were in under the Reign of good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and upon that excellent Advice which was given them for the <hi>prevention</hi> of their <hi>Ruine.</hi> Now thus it was.</p>
            <p>For many years backward there had been an unhappy <hi>diviſion and breach</hi> among the Of-ſpring of <hi>Jacob;</hi> the Nation was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two Bodies, the People became two diſtinct Houſes, and the Twelve Tribes that came peaceably together out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were now broken into two great Parties, and ſo <hi>ſrael</hi> was againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> Throne againſt Throne, and Altar againſt Altar.</p>
            <p>This Rent began under <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who was the Head of the Ten Tribes, and cauſed them to revolt from <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Solomon.</hi> During which unhappy Breach <hi>neither party</hi> Proſpered; yet <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that made the Breach firſt, proſper'd leaſt, and was undone firſt. Of twenty Kings that reigned over <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſucceſſively, there was <hi>ſcarce one,</hi> (I think we may ſay <hi>not ſo much as one)</hi> that ſerved God with an upright and ſincere heart; and of theſe <hi>Hoſhea</hi> was the laſt, in whoſe days <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their Tranſgreſſions were captivated and brought in ſubjection to a forein Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41051:6"/>
Now what was done to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was threatned to be done alſo to the Houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> becauſe that unnatural Breach had occaſioned the growth of Idolatry throughout the whole Land. <hi>Lo,</hi> (ſaid God) <hi>I will call all the families of the Kingdoms of the North, and they ſhall come, and they ſhall ſet every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jeruſalem, &amp;c. Jer.</hi> 1. 15, 16. To prevent which great evil if it were poſſible, good <hi>Joſtah</hi> ſetteth himſelf withall his heart to reform Religion, and to ſet the Worſhip of God to rights. He <hi>burneth all the veſſels of Baal, pulleth down the Idolatrous Prieſts, breaketh inpieces the Idol which was in the Temple, defileth Tophet,</hi> and the like Acts he did, as we read at large in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. And God was ſo well pleaſed with the King's Zele, even when the Reformation of Religion was in his intention and purpoſe onely, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him, that becauſe his Heart was tender, and he humbled himſelf before him, the evils threatned ſhould not befall <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> in his days; <hi>Thou ſhalt be gathered into thy grave in peace,</hi> ſaith the Lord to his Anointed, <hi>and thine eyes ſhall not ſee the evil which I will bring upon this place,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 20. Thus far God was gracious to the People of <hi>Judah,</hi> that for good <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s ſake he determined to defer (at leaſt) their deſtruction for a time; the King's Life was yet between them and ruin; as long as <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſhould live no alteration was to be, but things ſhould go with them after a tolerable good ſort: but when once their King ſhould be taken away, they were then to expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Deſolation and a Curſe, unleſs they did repent themſelves ſeriouſly and in time, according to <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s Example.</p>
            <p>It was at this time that the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was inſpir'd and ſent by Almighty God to tell all the People their Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to call them to repentance, and to acquaint them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand with their certain doom, if they continued in obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and hardneſs. <hi>Return</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye backſliding children; and if ye will return and put away your abominations, then ſhall you not remove</hi> (out of the Land.) <hi>Circumciſe your ſelves therefore to the Lord, and take away the fore-skin of your hearts, ye men of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah: waſh your hearts from wickedneſs thar ye may be ſaved. Be inſtructed, O Jeruſalem, leſt the Soul of God depart from thee, leſt he make thee deſolate, a land not inhabited.</hi> Theſe and ſuch as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41051:6"/>
theſe were the <hi>general</hi> Lectures which <hi>Jeremy</hi> preached in the ears of the people. But then he goes on to give them more <hi>particular</hi> Directions; he ſhews them the ſteps of their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; he bids them tread as the Saints and Servants of God did tread <hi>in the days of old;</hi> he requires them to lay aſide their love of Novelty and new-fangled Devices, and to go hand in hand (all of them unanimouſly and together) in that <hi>ancient way</hi> which did lead men to Heaven, when Religion was in its purity. Nothing but this could prevent <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Downfall, and the whole Nation's ruin; for all thoſe <hi>by-paths,</hi> which their Fancies had hitherto found out or made, did lead onely unto Miſchief and Deſtruction; there was no way of ſetting things to rights, or of giving them ſecurity, but to return to that <hi>ſound, good and holy Religion,</hi> which had been eſtabliſhed in the beginning: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and ſee and ask for the old paths, where the good way is, and walk therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words were ſpoken to the <hi>Jews</hi> by way of ſpecial direction; but they were left to the Church of God for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſe, and may be very profitable to us for particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; eſpecially when the Judgments of God threaten us, and <hi>two</hi> great Clouds hang over us, each laden with thunder, and each ready to diſcharge it ſelf upon our heads. And when the days of our Peace ſeem to be numbered; when for the <hi>diviſions among us great are the thoughts of heart,</hi> and thoſe Diviſions have haſtened that evil which our other ſins have deſerved: Then ſurely if ever is the time for us alſo to <hi>ſtand in our ways, and ſee</hi> whether 'tis that we are going, or to <hi>ask for the old paths,</hi> before we take a further ſtep, and fall into perdition. For all our preſent Calamities are come upon us, by reaſon that men have forſaken the <hi>old</hi> and the <hi>good way,</hi> (as I ſhall ſhew anon) thoſe private Avenues and unbeaten Paths, which the Singularity of ſome fond people hath ſought out, have ſerved onely to ſhelter a ſort of <hi>Hedg-birds and Banditi,</hi> to make a ſpoil of <hi>us</hi> and of <hi>them</hi> alſo. And therefore before we enter irrevocably into Ruin, before we ſee this once glorious Church to fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betrayed by thoſe who have been nurſed up in her Boſom, and have eaten of her Bread; before we preach her Funerals,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41051:7"/>
and lament at her Obſequies, while others laugh and ſing, <hi>Ah, Ah, ſo would we have it.</hi> If we have the leaſt ſenſe of any thing that is <hi>honourable, wiſe, or juſt,</hi> we cannot but look back upon our Declenſions, and be grieved for our Folly, and at laſt enquire after the <hi>old, good, and ſafe way, that we may find reſt for our Souls,</hi> before Trouble cometh upon our Loins, or the Harrow upon our Backs.</p>
            <p>So that I ſhall take occaſion to diſcourſe of this matter with immediate reſpect unto our ſelves; and in theſe times of <hi>dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy and danger,</hi> when things are in an unſettled condition with us, and Religion is off the hooks, or at leaſt turneth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very uncertain hinge; I ſhall direct my Brethren as <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> did the <hi>Jews,</hi> to <hi>the days of old,</hi> as the beſt (and perhaps the onely) Expedient to gain ſure Footing. And in the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this matter I ſhall ſhew, 1. What a reaſonable, juſt, and ſafe Propoſal this is, that we ſhould <hi>ask and ſeek for the old paths,</hi> and walk conſtantly therein, notwithſtanding their deſires of Alteration and Novelty, <hi>who are given to changes.</hi> 2. What an uſeful and advantageous thing it would be unto us, if we would but be ſo wiſe as to walk unanimouſly according to this Rule. 3. And how miſchievous and hurtful the Practices of thoſe have been and are, who have declined from this <hi>good way,</hi> who have left the <hi>old paths,</hi> to walk in Paths of their own tracing out.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this is a reaſonable, juſt, and ſafe Propoſal, that we ſhould ask for the <hi>old paths,</hi> and walk uniformly and conſtantly therein, notwithſtanding their deſires of Alteration and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty; <hi>who are given to changes.</hi> Antiquity is that which moſt people are fond of, for it gives a marvellous Credit to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Conſtitutions, and no Nations were ever yet ſo rude and barbarous, but that they have held thoſe things to be of moſt <hi>venerable</hi> and <hi>ſacred uſe,</hi> which have been of the moſt <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>ancient Inſtitution.</hi> We ſee it in all Humane <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> that they gain a mighty eſteem from the <hi>Date</hi> of their Foundation; the further they go to derive their Original, the more Fame and Veneration they acquire, and then moſt of all when their Original is like the Head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> that cannot be diſcover'd. We ſee it in all Humane <hi>Laws,</hi> that the longer they hold the deeper root they take, till at laſt they become
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41051:7"/>
               <hi>fundamental and immoveable.</hi> We ſee it in all Human <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> that when Antiquity hath worn them into Preſcriptions, they are like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians, unalterable:</hi> that you were as good ſtemm a Torrent, as ſtrive againſt a very ſilly Cuſtom, which has been handed down to men from their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. Now ſince Religion is derived from him who is <hi>the Ancient of days,</hi> ſince it is of the moſt Divine Deſcent, and the moſt perfect Conſtitution; it is ſtrange if Religious Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Cuſtoms ſhould not have at leaſt the <hi>ſame</hi> Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which all things in the world beſides have, that is, become <hi>the more lovely and venerable for being ancient.</hi> It is ſtrange that men ſhould moſt affect Singularity there, where they have the leaſt plea and reaſon to be ſingular.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed, 'tis neceſſary for me to lay down theſe three Cautions following, to prevent uncharitable miſtakes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I do not take upon me to defend the Validity of all <hi>Church Traditions</hi> at large, or to maintain the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to determine all Controverſies concerning <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Manners.</hi> Every man knows to how many juſt Exceptions that Pretence is liable; and I do not intend to do the <hi>Church of England</hi> that great diſſervice, as to ſay or intimate, that in theſe diſtracted times of ours it would be enough for us to have recourſe unto former Ages, and to ſtick to that which we find practiſed then. No, our Eſtabliſhments do not ſtand upon the Practice of the Church <hi>alone;</hi> there is a <hi>ſuperiour</hi> Rule of <hi>Scripture</hi> to which they are agreeable all of them, at leaſt none are <hi>contradictory:</hi> and therefore we do not look upon the Senſe and Practice of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times as the <hi>ſole</hi> or the <hi>main</hi> thing to be regarded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor do I intend to urge the Authority of Antiquity, as if <hi>every</hi> particular thing were to be obſerved religiouſly by us, which we find to have been inſtituted by the Apoſtles, or to have been obſerved in the Ages following. For ſeveral Rites were grounded in the beginning of Chriſtianity upon certain <hi>ſpecial</hi> Reaſons; which Reaſons <hi>failing</hi> and <hi>ceaſing</hi> in after times, thoſe Rites too have been thought fit to be laid aſide. Such was the <hi>Anointing of the ſick with oyl,</hi> which S. <hi>James</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and ſuch were the <hi>Agapae</hi> or <hi>Love-feasts</hi> mention'd by S. <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 12. and ſuch was the <hi>Veiling of women</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41051:8"/>
               <hi>in publick Aſſemblies,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 6. and ſuch was the <hi>Abſtinence from things ſtrangled and from bloud,</hi> which was enjoyned by the firſt Council at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 15. 29. And ſome other things there were very anciently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church, which yet this and other Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſaw reaſon to aboliſh or diſcontinue, as being uſeleſs now, or unſuitable to our Times. 'Tis not my purpoſe therefore out <note place="margin">See the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, <hi>Of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, why ſome are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> of a fond regard unto Antiquity to oblige men to revive thoſe Cuſtoms, though never ſo ancient, which the wiſdom of our Forefathers thought convenient to bury.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Much leſs would I perſuade the World to have any the leaſt Veneration for Antiquity <hi>in oppoſition to Chriſtianity;</hi> if any thing can be found among us, that is either <hi>in genere fidei</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, or <hi>in genere morum</hi> unlawful. For Cuſtom (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo gray-headed) cannot be any <hi>Preſcription in Bar of Truth,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cypr. ep.</hi> 73, 74.</note> and without Truth it is nothing elſe but an <hi>inveterate Error.</hi> But (God be bleſſed) this reacheth not to the prejudice of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> becauſe as nothing can be found in our Doctrine which is really <hi>falſe,</hi> ſo nothing can be found in our Diſcipline which is really and in the nature of the thing <hi>evil.</hi> Inſtead of thoſe many whiffling Pretenſions, which peeviſh and ignorant men have uſed againſt our <hi>Government,</hi> our <hi>Rites,</hi> and our <hi>Way of Worſhip,</hi> if they could ſhew us but one Maſculine Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prove our Eſtabliſhments to be <hi>contrary to God's Word,</hi> the Debate would ſoon be at an end, and we would give up our Cauſe, and our Lives alſo as well as our Livings to pleaſe them. But this Advantage we have, that many great and famous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in the Reformed Churches abroad, who have ſearched into our Conſtitutions with more Impartiality, that is, with better Eyes, and Judgments, and Spirits, than our own Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, could never yet diſcover any thing in them that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Scriptures. In former Ages <hi>Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Zanchius,</hi> and <hi>Melanchthon,</hi> and ſeveral excellent Writers more have delivered their Sence much in favour of our ſide. Nay the Learned <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, though he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by the neceſſities of Times to erect a New Diſcipline at <hi>Geneva,</hi> yet was he far from condemning the way of this Church. In an Epiſtle to the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> he did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41051:8"/>
that God had made him an eſpecial Inſtrument of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>purum &amp; ſincerum ſuum cultum in regno Angliae,</hi> his pure and ſincere Worſhip in the Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> and he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely condemned thoſe Seditious and Brain-ſick People, (for ſo he call'd them) who under colour of the Goſpel would have brought in Diſorder and Confuſion. In an Epiſtle to thoſe <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> at <hi>Frankfurt</hi> who would have alter'd our Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he intimates, that there was no manifeſt Impiety in them, and therefore adviſed them not to be <hi>ſtiff and capricious above meaſure.</hi> And in an Epiſtle to <hi>Bullinger</hi> he doth confeſs, that he himſelf perſuaded Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi> to Conformity. And in this laſt Age the great <hi>H. Grotius,</hi> who for Learning and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <note place="margin">Grot. ep. ad Gedeon. à Boe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</note> was the <hi>Phoenix</hi> almoſt of his time, look'd upon the way of the <hi>Church of England</hi> with admiration, as that which came neareſt to the Primitive Simplicity. And among the preſent Diſſenters, if ſuch as are more ſober and judicious than the reſt, would but pleaſe to ſpeak out, they muſt needs do us right too, and confeſs, that however ſome of our Uſages are not <hi>point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe</hi> juſt as they would have them, and ſuitable to their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, (and who can tell what will or can be ſo?) yet none of them are indeed naturally and intrinſecally <hi>unlawful.</hi> Nay, it is much to be ſuſpected, that thoſe <hi>wayward</hi> and <hi>hot</hi> Spirits among us, who are <hi>profeſt</hi> Patrons of Separation, would not find much fault neither, if their former Declamations againſt our way were but forgotten, and their Books burnt, and their Intereſt and Credit in the world were but ſecure; at leaſt, if their own Hands had but been concern'd in ſettling this way. They would have been well pleas'd, could they but have ſaid, <hi>Lo, this is the Bethel that we have built.</hi> But becauſe this beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fabrick was erected by other Hands, now nothing will ſerve their turn unleſs it be ſaid, <hi>Lo, this is the Babel that we have helped to pull down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſumme is this, that though the Plea of Antiquity be not ſufficient to juſtifie thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions, which either tend not to Edification, or are uſed after a Superſtitious manner and to Superſtitious ends, or are bad and ſinful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet if the Conſtitutions be ſuch as have been origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally occaſioned by ſome <hi>Scripture-hints and intimations;</hi> if

juſt reaſon any man can have againſt the asking for, and the walking in a way, ſo <hi>ancient,</hi> ſo <hi>laudable,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſafe.</hi> If he will not grant, that our Eſtabliſhments were inſtituted by the holy <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (which yet in probability is true, that they were appointed <hi>by them</hi> as things <hi>uſeful, decent,</hi> and <hi>convenient,</hi> though not as <hi>neceſſary in every particular)</hi> he muſt needs grant that they were appointed by <hi>due Authority,</hi> that is, by <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Perſons, and <hi>ſo</hi> may claim <hi>veneration</hi> and <hi>obſervance</hi> at our hands.

He ſaid like a wiſe man; and 'twould be much for the Peace of Chriſtendom, if all Chriſtians would reſolve in matters of <hi>Opinion</hi> to follow the <hi>Judgment,</hi> and in matters of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Practice,</hi> of the <hi>ancient Church.</hi> But ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats are for new Wine <hi>onely,</hi> not becauſe it is ſo <hi>good, (for the old is better)</hi> but becauſe it is <hi>new.</hi> And I am not likely to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade ſuch to conform to the Eſtabliſhments of our Church by this Argument, becauſe they are <hi>ancient</hi> Eſtabliſhments. Yet I would beſeech them to conſider, in the ſecond place, that the way we plead for, is not onely an <hi>old,</hi> but a <hi>good</hi> way alſo. We muſt not think, that the Contrivers of our Conſtitutions and Uſages were ſo many <hi>Fools,</hi> how low ſoever they may lie in the eſteem of men who have <hi>leſs</hi> Wiſdom and <hi>worſe</hi> Manners, and value a little <hi>Serpentine Craft</hi> above the <hi>Dove's Innocence.</hi> A Church being gather'd, it was impoſſible that without Laws that Society ſhould hold together, or anſwer the ends of its Foundation; and therefore <hi>Government</hi> was neceſſary; and of all ſorts of Government that by <hi>Biſhops</hi> was thought moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and fitting, becauſe preſumed to be the beſt Defenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt <hi>Faction, Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>Diſorder;</hi> and the <hi>Experience</hi> of all Ages hath found it to be ſo. Again, ſince the Church is a Collection of men <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>unlearned,</hi> who are ſet apart to worſhip God, and do hold their Title unto Chriſt by their Faith in him, it was judg'd very expedient, that <hi>Set Forms of Publick Prayer</hi> ſhould be preſcrib'd, both as a <hi>Repoſitory</hi> of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and ſound Doctrines, and likewiſe as a <hi>Proviſion</hi> for the neceſſities of the ignorant, and moreover as a <hi>Preſervative</hi> of Order, Unity, and Peace among Chriſtians. Laſtly, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Worſhip of God is to be celebrated with <hi>ſolemn</hi> Decency and Comlineſs, ſuitable in ſome degree to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Majeſty which is to be adored, certain <hi>outward</hi> Rites and Ceremonies were appointed, as good means to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi>

For by the Judgment and Practice of the whole World it doth appear, that an <hi>external</hi> Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Obſervance of Circumſtances (ſuch as <hi>Habits, Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Geſtures,</hi> &amp;c.) do bring a mighty <hi>reſpect</hi> to all <hi>ſecular</hi>

Tranſactions, and the Grandeur of <hi>Princes Courts,</hi> of <hi>Courts of Judicature,</hi> and of <hi>Civil Corporations,</hi> is much <hi>upheld,</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment becomes <hi>venerable</hi> by the uſe of <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> though <hi>little</hi> in their own nature. In like manner, the uſe of Ceremonies in the <hi>Service of God,</hi> and in all Sacred Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, doth make a great <hi>impreſſion</hi> on mens Minds, it <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth</hi> Reverence, (which is the <hi>ſecurity</hi> of Religion) and conveyeth through our <hi>ſenſes</hi> into our <hi>hearts</hi> an <hi>awful</hi> regard of what we are about; and as <hi>apparel</hi> upon our bodies ſerveth to maintain the <hi>vital heat</hi> within, ſo do theſe outward <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages</hi> help to preſerve the <hi>very heart</hi> of Religion, which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in true Piety and Devotion.</p>
            <p>This is enough to ſhew the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of thoſe who firſt chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out unto us this old way, for which we now plead. And before men cry out againſt this way, they ſhould do well to conſider, whether they can direct us to a <hi>better.</hi> But our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> could <hi>never yet</hi> do this. They could pull down our <hi>Government,</hi> and throw out our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> (which yet was quite contrary to their Solemn Declaration;) they could <hi>aboliſh</hi> our <note place="margin">Declarat. of <hi>April</hi> 9. 1642.</note> Ceremonies, and <hi>deſtroy</hi> our Diſcipline, (and any <hi>Child</hi> or <hi>Dunce</hi> can ſpoil a Model, which none but an <hi>Artiſt</hi> can ſet together.) But though they had the <hi>confidence</hi> to <hi>mar</hi> things, yet they had not amongſt them all the <hi>wit</hi> to <hi>mend</hi> them.

been <hi>wiſe men;</hi> 'tis ſtrange (I ſay) ſince theſe Starters aſide from the old Paths never altered thoſe Eſtabliſhments which our Fathers left us, but ſtill they altered them for the worſe. What a thin, pitiful, and impertinent buſineſs was the <hi>Directory</hi> in compariſon of our <hi>Service-book?</hi> And yet that was the <hi>onely</hi> thing that was <hi>like</hi> a Platform, and that did not very well pleaſe <hi>themſelves.</hi> And ſince His Majeſty's Reſtauration a <hi>new Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> was offered to the World for a <hi>Tryal of Skill,</hi> and yet it would not paſs; the Contrivers of it could not ſatisfie either <hi>us</hi> or their <hi>own Party</hi> by it. And if you will go back to <hi>former</hi> times, you will find that they were <hi>Bunglers</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. To which purpoſe the ſtory is obſervable, which the Learned and Excellent Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> relates of thoſe four <hi>Claſses</hi> 
               <note place="margin">View of the new Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> of Reformers in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who had ſet themſelves up in this Kingdom. <q>Theſe had made complaint to the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> againſt our Liturgy, and entertained hopes of obtaining his Favour in that buſineſs about the Year 1585. He demanded of them whether they deſired the <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of all Liturgy?</hi> They anſwered, <hi>No.</hi> He then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to make a <hi>better,</hi> ſuch as they ſhould deſire to have ſettled inſtead of this. The <hi>firſt Claſſis</hi> did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frame a new one, (which I ſuppoſe was that Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers mentioned by Biſhop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> but it was) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

Now certainly that outward Frame and Conſtitution of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was very <hi>wiſely</hi> contrived, which <hi>Clubs</hi> of peeviſh and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Spirits have been <hi>pecking</hi> at for theſe <hi>hundred</hi> years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet are at a loſs how to raiſe any <hi>tolerable</hi> good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick upon the <hi>ruins</hi> of the <hi>old</hi> one. And then I appeal to any <hi>indifferent</hi> perſon, whether it be not the ſafeſt courſe for men to walk in <hi>that</hi> way, which (taking it from one end to the other, and in the main) is ſo good condition'd, that either you <hi>need not</hi> or <hi>cannot</hi> mend it.</p>

3. And yet, beſides what has been ſaid already, there is a <hi>third</hi> very conſiderable Argument, to ſhew what great Reaſon we have to ſtick to our Eſtabliſhments; and it is this, that our Way is not onely <hi>Ancient</hi> (in reſpect of it ſelf) and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably <hi>uſeful</hi> (in reſpect of its ends) but is alſo that which was <hi>generally</hi> uſed by <hi>all Profeſſors</hi> of Chriſtianity in the <hi>beginning.</hi> Had our Government and Diſcipline been <hi>Local,</hi> and ſet up in this Church of <hi>England alone,</hi> there might have been ſome room for an Impeachment of <hi>Singularity.</hi> But you ſhall ſee, that the Way which is ſettled among us, was for the moſt part the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>common</hi> Road which all Saints and Martyrs obſerved of old; ſo that we do not onely plead <hi>Preſcription,</hi> but we plead it from the <hi>joynt conſent</hi> of all Chriſtendom; and our Conſtitutions carry as great Countenance and Authority, as the <hi>Catholic</hi> Church can give them. Scarcely ſhall you find <hi>any</hi> ancient Records of either the <hi>Aſiatic,</hi> or <hi>African,</hi> or <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Churches, but we can fetch Teſtimonies out of them touching the <hi>univerſal</hi> uſe of moſt of our Eſtabliſhments, if not all. And can we reaſonably think, that a Platform ſo received all Chriſtendom over without contradiction, and handed down unto us from the Practice of <hi>all</hi> Natious, ſo <hi>ſeparated</hi> by diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>place,</hi> and ſo <hi>divided</hi> by differences of <hi>language,</hi> could be an <hi>Impoſture</hi> or <hi>Corruption?</hi> Is it not rather to be preſumed, (as a thing <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>likely</hi> at leaſt) that it came <hi>originally</hi> from the hands of thoſe, who firſt planted Chriſtianity in the <hi>ſeveral</hi> Quarters of the World?

Well, to mend the matter a little, ſuppoſe this Author of theſe Cuſtoms to have been a Perſon of <hi>Note</hi> and <hi>Eminence</hi> in the Church; yet we are much miſtaken if we think, that the Governours of the Church were ſuch <hi>tame, eaſie,</hi> and <hi>flexible</hi> men, as to receive and admit of <hi>new</hi> Cuſtoms upon the Recommendation of a <hi>ſingle</hi>

or <hi>private</hi> Perſon, though of <hi>unqueſtionable</hi> Integrity, for they refus'd Offers made them by <hi>whole Churches.</hi> For inſtance: The difference about the keeping of Eaſter is as famous as it was old. The Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> obſerved it on the day of the <hi>Jews</hi> Paſſover, on whatſoever day of the week that happened. The Weſtern Churches obſerved upon the day when our Lord roſe from the dead. This Variety of Obſervation was from the beginning, (if there be any truth in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory)</hi> and in a little time it begat a Controverſie, firſt between two <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Anicetus</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> S. <hi>John</hi>'s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple. The matter was <hi>debated</hi> between them, but neither could <hi>Polycarpus</hi> perſuade <hi>Anicetus</hi> to recede from <hi>his</hi> Cuſtom, nor could <hi>Anicetus</hi> perſuade <hi>Polycarpus</hi> to recede from <hi>his.</hi> So they parted good Friends. Almoſt thirty years after, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie <note place="margin">Euſeb. Eccleſ. Hiſt. l. 5. c. 23, 24.</note> was revived between <hi>whole Churches,</hi> in the time of <hi>Polycrates</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Several <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synods</hi> were ſummoned to conſider of the matter; and on <hi>each</hi> hand <hi>Tradition</hi> was urged. The Weſtern Churches inſiſted upon a Tradition which <hi>they</hi> had received from ſome of the Apoſtles; the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> pleaded a Tradition which <hi>they</hi> had received from S. <hi>John,</hi> (who 'tis likely <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi> that Cuſtom to them to gratifie the <hi>Jews:)</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Plea on both ſides was <hi>good.</hi> But ſo ſtiff they were on <hi>each</hi> hand, that <hi>no</hi> Arguments could prevail with <hi>either</hi> Party to relinquiſh their <hi>old</hi> Cuſtom, and to take up the other; ſo that <hi>Victor</hi> in a great heat would have cut off <hi>tot &amp; tantas Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſias Dei,</hi> ſo <hi>many</hi> and ſuch <hi>eminent</hi> Churches of God, from his Communion, had not the great Prelate of <hi>Lyons, Irenaeus,</hi> ſtood in the gap, and reprehended <hi>Victor</hi> for his <hi>raſhneſs.</hi> Now he that ſhall ſeriouſly conſider <hi>this ſtory</hi> with all its Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cannot with reaſon believe, that the Ancient Churches were <hi>eaſie</hi> to be <hi>impos'd</hi> upon, or to be <hi>corrupted</hi> with Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, when they ſtood out ſo <hi>reſolutely</hi> againſt an <hi>innocent</hi> Tradition. Much leſs is it credible, that a <hi>few</hi> Perſons, though of <hi>Repute</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> could poſſibly <hi>leven</hi> all Churches in Chriſtendom with their private Inventions. And therefore when we conſider, how <hi>all</hi> Churches of old did conſpire, as in the <hi>ſame Faith,</hi> ſo in the <hi>ſame Government,</hi> in the <hi>ſame Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41051:13"/>
and <hi>generally</hi> in the <hi>ſame Rites</hi> too (and thoſe now in uſe with <hi>us</hi> here,) we muſt needs be <hi>ſtartled</hi> in our thoughts, and be <hi>poſed</hi> to conceive, how theſe things could ariſe all at once <hi>of themſelves,</hi> without any hand (like ſo many Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes that ſtart out of the Earth in a Night,) or how they could be diſſeminated by any <hi>Private</hi> hand. Rather it ſeemeth reaſonable to impute them to the <hi>Special Providence</hi> of God, and to the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the firſt Miniſters of Religion, who <hi>probably</hi> did <hi>recommend</hi> theſe uſages, as things <hi>uſeful</hi> or <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,</hi> though they did not <hi>Ordain,</hi> or <hi>Impoſe</hi> them as things <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>univerſally Neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not pretend peremptorily to derive <hi>all</hi> our Cuſtomes from Apoſtolical Practice; although there are ſuch fair evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Antiquity of many of them, that we might <hi>ſtrongly</hi> argue <hi>that</hi> point, if the Ancient Chriſtians may be allowed (what is allowed Jews and Heathens) to be good Witneſſes of <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Fact.</hi> But my purpoſe is to prove, that our preſent Eſtabliſhments in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are of a <hi>very Venerable date;</hi> and for that Reaſon, to contend, that they ought not to <hi>give place</hi> to Novelties, as if they were of <hi>no moment;</hi> or to be <hi>kick'd down,</hi> as if they are <hi>Deſpicable.</hi> So that if better Arguments may be ſetch'd from Antiquity on their <hi>behalf,</hi> than can be brought <hi>againſt</hi> them, I have obtained my Ends; and in order to that, I urge the <hi>General,</hi> as well as <hi>Ancient</hi> uſage of them: For certainly one Church ought to have regard to the Conſtitutions of other (and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Ancient) Catholick Churches, or elſe St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Argument is trifling in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. where condemning the covering of Mens Heads, and the uncovering of Womens in Religious Aſſemblies, he confronts the Practice, by urging the cuſtom obſerved in all Places beſides <hi>Corinth, We have no ſuch cuſtom, neither the Churches of God:</hi> And in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Judgment that was enough to determine the Controverſie.</p>
            <p>Two things may be objected againſt what hath been ſpoken. Firſt, That the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches were univerſally deceived in the Primitive Times, and that in two Inſtances. 1. They all believed, that after the World was 6000 years old, there would be a general Reſurrection of the Dead, and then that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41051:14"/>
Chriſt would Reign on Earth a thouſand Years. Secondly, It was an univerſal cuſtom, to give the Sacrament of the Lords Supper even to Infants, after they were Baptized. And if all the Anolent Churches were actually cheated in <hi>two</hi> things, 'tis probable, that they were in <hi>more</hi> alſo; at leaſt, nothing can be brought from the General Practice of thoſe Churches, to make their Cuſtoms venerable.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to the former Inſtance, I have three things to offer briefly: 1. That it was not matter of <hi>Fact</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> but matter of <hi>Opinion</hi> only, in which the World might be more eaſily abuſed; becauſe, points of <hi>Doctrin</hi> are not obvious to the <hi>Senſes,</hi> and are more hard to be retained in the <hi>Memories</hi> of men, than things of <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> And therefore Tradition is <hi>not</hi> allowed to be a ſafe Record of things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Faith,</hi> but the <hi>Scriptures</hi> only. 2. That this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion was not derived from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but came Originally from ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> converted to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> who were mixed up and down in the Churches of Chriſt. For ſuch an old Tradition we read of, called the Tradition of the Houſe of <hi>Rabbi Elias,</hi> that the World ſhould continue 6000 Years, and then, that the <hi>Everlaſting Sabbath</hi> ſhould begin. Which Fancy continuing in the Minds of moſt Chriſtian Jews, <hi>Papias,</hi> and other Chriſtians, came by degrees to imbibe it, by converſing with thoſe of the Circumciſion, who were diſperſed all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom over. 3. And yet, thirdly, this was <hi>no univerſal</hi> Doctrine, by your favour. For <hi>Euſebius ſaith,</hi> that <hi>Many</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Euſeb. <hi>Hiſt. Eccl. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>in fine.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Eccleſiaſtical perſons were abuſed with this Error.</hi> And <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> tells us, that though <hi>he himſelf,</hi> and <hi>many others</hi> were of that Opinion, yet there were <hi>many others,</hi> men of pure and pious Judgments, who did not think ſo. And ſhew me, if you can, any ſuch in thoſe days, that were againſt the received <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> 
               <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the Church.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to the latter Inſtance, we have reaſon to affirm, that the giving of the Communion to Baptized Infants, was not an <hi>univerſal</hi> cuſtom in the Primitive Times, whatever ſome Learned men have ſuggeſted to the contrary. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the exuberant Piety of thoſe Ages, that they would not fail in any thing which <hi>ſeemed</hi> to be a Duty and a ſecurity
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41051:14"/>
of their hopes; and ſome did run away with a miſconſtruction of thoſe words of our Saviour in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 53. But ſuppoſe that this was an uſual Cuſtom in <hi>ſome</hi> particular Churches, it is not fair that one ſingle Exception (if yet it be an <hi>Exception)</hi> ſhould void a <hi>whole</hi> Rule; and all that we can gather from it is, that <hi>all</hi> their Cuſtoms were not of Apoſtolical Inſtitution: nor do we ſay they were; onely Iurge, that where their Cuſtoms were univerſal in the firſt Ages, there is a fair <hi>probability</hi> that they came from good hands, and a ſufficient Argument for <hi>us</hi> to walk in a way which was ſo univerſally old. But laſtly, in anſwer to both theſe Objections it is clear, that as well the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Opinion,</hi> as this <hi>Custom,</hi> met in time with publick <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> for the one was diſown'd, and the other was laid aſide in following Ages; and ſo the Inſtances do not reach <hi>us,</hi> whoſe Eſtabliſhments have paſſed all along <hi>without</hi> condemnation or cenſure, (nay with <hi>acceſſions</hi> and <hi>advantage)</hi> till of late ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet men reſolved to run far enough from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ran themſelves out of their <hi>wits</hi> and <hi>five ſenſes,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the <hi>Golden Mean</hi> took too quick a ſtep out of <hi>Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> into <hi>Confuſion,</hi> and now are in a fair way to run round again out of <hi>Confuſion</hi> into <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I hope that our Plea of Antiquity in defence of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions ſtandeth yet fair, notwithſtanding this <hi>firſt</hi> Pretence. The next is, that even in the Apoſtles days <hi>the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity was working,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 7. For they who are not Friends to the way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do <hi>generally (but wrongfully)</hi> underſtand by that Myſtery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>a Spirit of Tyranny and Superſtition</hi> even in the <hi>bowels of Chriſt's Spouſe,</hi> that was then ſetting up for <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundations of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and a <hi>ceremonious, pompous</hi> way of Worſhip, and whatſoever elſe men will pleaſe to ſay.</p>
            <p>For the voiding of this Pretence, 1. We do aknowledge, that there was a ſort of men in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s days, (and the leſs wonder if there are ſuch now) that were like Moles, blind and buſie Creatures, working under ground, reſtleſs and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, notwithſtanding their ſoft, delicate, and ſmooth Skin. But then, ſecondly, we do utterly deny (and 'tis a marvel that any man of Learning ſhould have the confidence to affirm) that

theſe were <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> living in the <hi>communion</hi> of the Church, and under the <hi>guidance</hi> and <hi>government</hi> of the Holy Apoſtles.

Theſe were that <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> which was then working and factoring for <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> And what is this to the true Church? For there was no evil then working <hi>within</hi> the Church; there was no preparing of Materials for the Kingdom of the Devil <hi>within</hi> the Church; there was no Idolatry in the Mint, nor Superſtition upon the Anvil, <hi>within</hi> the Church; but indeed <hi>without</hi> there was hard working, ſweating and toiling; ſo that after the death of the Apoſtles many Errors were ſcatter'd by theſe Preachers of <note place="margin">Hegeſippus in Euſeb. Eccl. Hiſt. l. 3. c. 32.</note> Knowledge, falſly ſo called, who counterfeited themſelves Chriſtians, and lurked among thoſe who were Chriſtians in truth and reality. But ſhall we be unjuſt and wicked like the Pagans, reviling the whole ancient Church for the ſake of theſe old villanous Sectaries?

Now it would be to the purpoſe, if it could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> that <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> were the <hi>found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of our <hi>Prelacy,</hi> or the <hi>Authors</hi> of our <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> But it is obvious, that they were the <hi>firſt</hi> (though not the laſt) the <hi>hated and oppos'd Epiſcopal Authority,</hi> and that they uſed quite <hi>different</hi> and moſt <hi>monſtrous</hi> Rites in their filthy Aſſemblies; and as ſoon it may be proved, that <hi>their</hi> and <hi>our</hi> Faith is the ſame: whereas it is known, that they denied the Reality of Chriſt's Incarnation and Paſſion, (and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon came not to the Chriſtian Communion;) and that their Creed was a confuſed Meſs of Heathen Mythology concerning <note place="margin">S.

Briefly then; If the way Eſtabliſh'd in this Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be the old <hi>Chriſtian</hi> way; if it be ſo excellently contrived, that no other Conſtitution can be better (or, ſo well) framed to anſwer the ends of <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> if it be that way, which for the greateſt (if not in every) part thereof, is that which was univerſally obſerved for very many Centuries, all along, from the Pure and Primitive Times of <hi>Chriſtiantiy;</hi> then have we reaſon to believe, that it was <hi>originally</hi> laid out, not by the <hi>Invention</hi> of a <hi>Private</hi> Perſon or two, or by the <hi>Confederacy</hi> of crafty Impoſtors, but by the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>competent</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, whoſe buſineſs it was to <hi>ſet things in order</hi> in the <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 34.</note> Churches of Chriſt: To be ſure, we have then great Reaſon to ask for this old Path, where the good Way is, and to walk therein, notwithſtanding the deſires and endeavours of thoſe, which are given to changes. And thus the firſt thing is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, which I propounded to diſcourſe of.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond Conſideration now followeth, that it would be a thing greatly uſeful and advantageous unto us (as well as juſt in it ſelf) if we would but unanimouſly agree to walk ſteddily in this Good old way.</p>
            <p>And truly, many excellent ends there are, to which the Practice of this thing would be highly ſerviceable.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

For this very much helpeth to bring Religion into <hi>Requeſt,</hi> and extorteth a Confeſſion from its very Enemies, that of a truth God is in them that do profeſs it; whereas Confuſion and Diſorders in a Church, either for <hi>want</hi> of a ſixt Rule, or by the <hi>neglect</hi> of it, doth but expoſe Religion to <hi>Reproach,</hi> and its Profeſſors to <hi>Scorn. If there come in</hi> (into irregular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations) <hi>thoſe that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not ſay, that ye are mad?</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaks pertinently to my purpoſe. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23.</p>

2. To walk together in the good Old Path, would be an excellent means, as to put an <hi>Outward Gloſs</hi> upon Religion, ſo alſo to recover that <hi>Inward Life</hi> of it, which conſiſteth in <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and brotherly <hi>Love.</hi> Scarcely is any thing ſo much wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting among us as <hi>Charity,</hi> though the Holy Ghoſt doth up and down command us to be <hi>rooted</hi> and <hi>grounded, to walk and to be knit together,</hi> to <hi>abound</hi> and <hi>continue in,</hi> and to <hi>provoke one another unto Love.</hi> Mens forſaking of the good Old Way, has been the <hi>Occaſion</hi> and <hi>Riſe</hi> of all that uncharitableneſs, which is the <hi>Monſtrous</hi> Sin, and the <hi>Characteriſtical note</hi> of this Age, when inſtead of being <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Doves,</hi> ſome count it a piece of Religion, to be <hi>worſe</hi> than <hi>wolves</hi> and <hi>Vultures,</hi> ready to devour <hi>one another.</hi> For in the Primitive Times, when <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> could diſpute <hi>well,</hi> and live <hi>better,</hi> the very <hi>Heathens</hi> could not but obſerve with Admiration, how they loved one another. Men have <hi>ceaſed</hi> to be our Friends, ſince they refuſed to go the <hi>uſual</hi> way with us into the Houſe of God, and parted from us into different and by-roads: And that <hi>ill-natur'd</hi> Sect, which <hi>first</hi> divided from us, is juſtly rewarded with <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> doom, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. 12. <hi>That his hand is againſt every man, and every mans hand againſt him.</hi> And, as far as I can ſee, things are likely to go on ſtill at this rate, 'till men will be ſo <hi>kind</hi> to themſelves, and ſo <hi>juſt</hi> to us, as to quit thoſe Novel courſes, and uncouth paths, in which <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Singularity,</hi> and a <hi>Spirit of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> (together with <hi>baſe</hi> reſpects to their <hi>Secular</hi> Intereſt) have cauſed them to wander hitherto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A thing which is the more deſirable (eſpecially, at this juncture and nick of time) becauſe, <hi>thirdly,</hi> it would infinitely ſerve to the <hi>general Quiet</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of us All. It would unite our <hi>Intereſts,</hi> as well as our <hi>Affections;</hi> 'twould compoſe our <hi>Minds,</hi> and our <hi>Affairs</hi> too; 'twould not only make us live together with <hi>one mind</hi> in an Houſe; but, moreover it would <hi>eſtabliſh our Houſe,</hi> and make it <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>firm,</hi> and <hi>ſafe,</hi> over our Heads. For, 'tis not <hi>every</hi> difference in <hi>Opinion,</hi> that expoſeth a <hi>Church,</hi> or a <hi>Nation</hi> to danger; but 'tis fighting and quarrelling about the <hi>Main way</hi> that ruins all. We know, that among the <hi>Turks,</hi> there are ſeveral <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> and different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, and yet the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire holds (though it be a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41051:17"/>
moſt <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical</hi> Policy,) and the Intereſt of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> is carried on (though it be a moſt <hi>palpable</hi> and <hi>fulſome</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture,) becauſe, though they <hi>jangle</hi> in matters of <hi>leſſer</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet they are <hi>true</hi> to their <hi>Common</hi> Intereſt, and agree in the <hi>Main,</hi> and cloſely adhere to their <hi>general</hi> Model of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Religion,</hi> and <hi>Worſhip.</hi> In like manner, among the Romaniſts <hi>themſelves</hi> (who boaſt ſo much of the <hi>Unity</hi> of their Church) there are many very <hi>Conſiderable</hi> Diviſions, and more, perhaps, than there are among <hi>Us,</hi> and thoſe as hotly maintained; and yet <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> know how to agree <hi>against</hi> Chriſt; the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> and <hi>Thomiſts,</hi> the <hi>Moliniſts</hi> and <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſts,</hi> the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and the reſt, are wiſe enough to hang <hi>together</hi> under the <hi>Laws</hi> of their Church; they go quietly, and <hi>hand in hand</hi> in the <hi>main</hi> way; they conſpire in one <hi>Common</hi> Form; they are tite to their <hi>Government,</hi> and keep cloſe to their <hi>Rubricks</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſhments;</hi> and as long as the Pope can but keep things in this Channel, either by the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Inquiſition, or by other Politick Arts, he knows that his, and his Churches Intereſt is ſafe, and he needs not make uſe of his pretended <hi>Infallibility</hi> to determine thoſe points which are controverted. I wiſh that we would learn ſo much wit of <hi>the Adverſaries</hi> of True Religion, as not to fall out <hi>there,</hi> where the ſafety of us all is concern'd; but walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like Friends, in that plain way, which the Ancient Church hath beaten out before us, and the Laws of our Land have fenced in; for differences in matters of Speculation, and points diſputable, could not hurt us, or lay us open to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if ſome among us were but <hi>True</hi> to our <hi>Common</hi> Intereſt; if they would but ſtick to our Eſtabliſhments, which are the <hi>Rampiers,</hi> and <hi>Bullwarks</hi> of the Church; if they would but be as zealous for Chriſt, as the Turk is for <hi>Mahomet;</hi> or, as the Jeſuit is for Him, whom ſome ſuppoſe to be Antichriſt. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all Probability can give us Reſt to our Souls, and Security to our Nation, and Proſperity to our Religion, but this <hi>one</hi> thing, to ſeek after the good Old Way: Men may pleaſe themſelves with Fancies, and try many fruitleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, and make experiments of this, and of that <hi>Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> but the World will ſee in the end that <hi>nothing</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41051:17"/>
but the obſerving of the Old Path will put us into a <hi>good</hi> poſture.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But yet, fourthly, there is one huge Advantage more, which the performance of this matter would bring unto us, and that indeed which I ſhall chiefly inſiſt on, and it is this; That it would juſtifie our <hi>whole Cauſe</hi> before all the World, and cut off all <hi>juſt</hi> occaſion from thoſe, who wrongfully upbraid us <hi>all</hi> for <hi>Innovators,</hi> and under that pretence trepan many a Soul. <hi>Where</hi> (ſay they) <hi>was your Religion before Luther?</hi> Now the <hi>Diſſenter</hi> is not able to anſwer this Queſtion <hi>truly, throughly,</hi> or <hi>to ſatisfaction;</hi> becauſe <hi>a great part</hi> of his Religion was <hi>no where</hi> in the world, no not <hi>in Luther</hi>'s days; and ſo the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> have a <hi>continual</hi> and <hi>unanſwerable</hi> Objection to fling in <hi>his</hi> teeth. But the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as it is eſtabliſh'd, hath a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>full</hi> Plea, that her whole Religion was <hi>long</hi> before Popery; that it was in the world in the days of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> that it was in the <hi>Liturgies</hi> of the <hi>primitive Churches;</hi> that it is to be ſeen ſtill in the <hi>Tomes</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers: nay, ſhe can juſtifie her Cauſe out of thoſe <hi>very Writers</hi> in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> both before and ſince the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> whoſe Books they (like diſhoneſt men) have correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, purged, and mangled by the <hi>Expurgatory Indices,</hi> leſt they ſhould tell tales.</p>
            <p>I do not intend now to vindicate the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our Church in this reſpect; for that is not ſo much to my preſent purpoſe, and our Faith hath been by others abundantly proved, to be exactly conſonant to the Sence of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and to the Faith of all <hi>Orthodox</hi> Chriſtians in the pureſt and beſt Ages; and by this we are ready to <hi>ſtand</hi> or <hi>fall,</hi> let the Papiſt bark at us till his Tongue and his Heart aketh.</p>
            <p>But my purpoſe is to juſtifie the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of our Church to be the ſame which was uſed in Chriſtian Churches from the beginning; and that againſt a ſort of men among our ſelves who accuſe us of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> as the Papiſts
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41051:18"/>
do accuſe us of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> though God be bleſſed we are guilty of <hi>neither.</hi> We tell our Diſſenting Brethren, that <hi>our</hi> way, which they have forſaken, is indeed the <hi>old</hi> Path; we affirm our Government to have been <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical;</hi> and we ſay too, that our <hi>Diſcipline, Rites,</hi> and <hi>way of Worſhip</hi> is the ſame generally which was eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> times; and this I ſhall endeavour now to prove in ſome meaſure by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing in particulars, that men who deſire ſatisfaction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in may ſee, that the Frame of our Religion is <hi>de facto</hi> very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; and that on <hi>that</hi> account (beſides <hi>many</hi> others) it ought to be <hi>upheld</hi> and <hi>maintain'd,</hi> (which is the thing I have already argued for;) and withall, that our Charge of <hi>Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> would be <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> did we but unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to tread in this Path: our <hi>Brethren</hi> then would be free from guilt as well as <hi>our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt thing to be ſpoken to is <hi>our Form of Government,</hi> I mean our <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> the thing that is ſuch an <hi>Eye-ſore</hi> to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Atheiſts, and Schiſmaticks. It is clear, that for 1500 years it was the <hi>onely</hi> kind of Government in the Church. And whatever ſome Learned men have pretended, I believe you can ſcarcely inſtance in any ancient Churches, <hi>perfectly</hi> and <hi>completely</hi> formed, that were not under the care and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Biſhops, (in our preſent Sence of the word;) Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops preſiding over them either <hi>in perſon,</hi> or by their <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Thoſe great Luminaries of the Church, to whom the World hath been and is ſo much beholding, the <hi>Austins, Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Chryſoſtoms, Baſils, Cyrils, Gregories,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſes,</hi> were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowned <hi>Prelates,</hi> ſome of them <hi>Metropolitanes,</hi> ſome <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> all of them <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Thoſe Fathers of the <hi>third</hi> Century <hi>after</hi> the Apoſtles, (as <hi>Theodoret, Jerom,</hi> and others) who thought the Names of Biſhop and Presbyter to be <hi>indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently</hi> and <hi>promiſcuouſly</hi> uſed in the Scripture, did not mean to <hi>impair</hi> the juſt <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of Biſhops; for they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that though the <hi>Names</hi> were in common, yet the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Power,</hi> and <hi>Orders,</hi> were <hi>diſtinct,</hi> (eſpecially as to <hi>ſome</hi> things, as that of <hi>Ordination;)</hi> and they all taught, that even
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41051:18"/>
in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, or at leaſt before S. <hi>John</hi>'s death, there were <hi>three ſeveral</hi> Degrees of Miniſters in the Church; and <note place="margin">Tert. de Bapt.

               <note place="margin">Iren. lib. 3. c. 3. Hegeſip. in Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib. 4. c. 22. Id. de Dionyſ. c. 23. Clem. Rom. Ep. ad Cor.</note> 
               <hi>Hegeſippus, Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Corinth, Clement</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and out of thoſe <hi>Canons</hi> which go under the Name of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (many whereof were framed and obſerved in that Age) it doth appear to any conſiderate and indifferent perſon, that certain particular Men called <hi>Biſhops</hi> were in thoſe early days of Chriſtianity entruſted with the <hi>Superintendency</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> over <hi>whole</hi> Churches. But above all, the Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> a Contemporary of the Apoſtles themſelves, yield us ſo many and ſuch ſtrong Arguments of this matter, that they who have been <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> from the <hi>Catholic</hi> Church in this particular of Government, have uſed all their Art and Skill to <hi>decry</hi> thoſe Epiſtles, as ſpurious and fictitious, though the late Reverend Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and the preſent <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> have laboured <note place="margin">Diſſertationes vindiciae.</note> with ſo much <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Succeſs</hi> to prove thoſe Epiſtles to be the <hi>genuine</hi> iſſue of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that they have ſaid enough to lay this whole Controverſie <hi>aſleep,</hi> unleſs Men will expect that an Angel from Heaven ſhall Preach to us to <hi>bury our Diſputes,</hi> as well as Summon us with the ſound of a Trumpet, to come out of our <hi>Graves.</hi> Briefly; the moſt ancient Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical writers, where they <hi>reckon up the Orders</hi> of thoſe who were intruſted with the work of the Miniſtry, do ſo carefully <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> between <hi>Biſhops</hi> as the firſt Order, and <hi>Presbyters</hi> as the ſecond, that the moſt Learned of that Party, who are no good friends to <hi>Epiſcopal Government,</hi> have been <hi>forced</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that Epiſcopacy was the <hi>only</hi> Government of the Church
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41051:19"/>
in the moſt Primitive times, that is, in the <hi>very next Age</hi> to the Apoſtles; but that Age they do except; and we ſhall ſee the Practice of that Age too anon.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it may be Objected, that Antiquity is an <hi>incompetent</hi> witneſs to prove, that Epiſcopacy was the ſetled form of Government in the <hi>firſt</hi> Ages; and that upon theſe three accounts. 1. Becauſe we have no <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> account of the <hi>uniformity</hi> of Epiſcopal Government in all Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Plantations; ſo that for ought we know it <hi>might vary</hi> in ſome places. But this is a fallacious way of arguing, becauſe a <hi>Negative</hi> is not to be proved from the ſilence of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as to the conſtitution of <hi>ſome</hi> parts of Chriſtendom. Though we have no exact Records of what St. <hi>Thomas</hi> did in <hi>Parthia,</hi> or St. <hi>Andrew</hi> in <hi>Scythia,</hi> or ſome other Apoſtles in their reſpective <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Dioceſes and Juriſdictions, yet it doth not follow, that they either did, or might ſet up <hi>another</hi> form of Government, different from that in other Churches. When by the joint-Teſtimony of the firſt writers, and their followers, we find, that Epiſcopal Chairs were ſet up in all the Weſtern parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and in ſundry other Countries, Provinces, and Cities; when <hi>Ireneus,</hi> who was <hi>Polycarp</hi>'s Diſciple, and but one remove from the Apoſtles, tells us <note place="margin">Hier. in Catal. Iren. lib. 3. c. 3.</note> plainly and peremptorily, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> were inſtituted by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and that he was able to <hi>enumerate</hi> (but that he ſhould be too prolix) <hi>Omnium Eccleſiarum Succeſſiones,</hi> thoſe (Biſhops) who ſucceeded the Apoſtles in <hi>all</hi> Churches: and when St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> who was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>fellow-labourer,</hi> tells us expreſly, <hi>that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 3. Clem. Ep. p. 54.</note> 
               <hi>the Apoſtles preaching through Countries and Cities, ordained the firſt Fruits of them to be Biſhops and Deacons,</hi> for thoſe who ſhould afterwards believe; we have no reaſon to doubt, but that <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> was erected <hi>every where,</hi> though by the iniquity of times ſome Records of particular Churches are loſt unto <hi>us,</hi> which were extant in <hi>former</hi> Ages. They who argue from the defect of Teſtimonies, that another Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there <hi>might</hi> be, would do well to ſhew us from Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies extant that another Government there <hi>was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41051:19"/>
2. It may be pretended, that Antiquity is no competent witneſs of Epiſcopal Government ſetled in the firſt Ages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Teſtimonies <hi>we have,</hi> do not give us a <hi>particular</hi> Catalogue of thoſe Biſhops who ſucceeded the Apoſtles. And to this purpoſe is urged that of <hi>Euſebius, that it is not eaſie to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Euſeb. l. 3. c. 4.</note> 
               <hi>tell,</hi> what, or who they were, that were appointed to feed the Church, ſetting aſide thoſe whom we pick out of the writings of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Now to this Allegation there are four things in Anſwer. 1. That <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaks <hi>only</hi> of the Biſhops in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia.</hi> 2. That he declared it not altogether impoſſible, but <hi>ſomewhat hard</hi> (meaning, for him, who was at ſome conſiderable diſtance from the firſt Age) to give account of the Apoſtles Succeſſors in all <hi>thoſe</hi> Churches. 3. That the difficulty was, not as to the <hi>Succeſſion it ſelf,</hi> but as to the particular <hi>Names</hi> of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Biſhops (for ſo <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his Interpreter did underſtand <note place="margin">Quorum nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na non eſt facilè explicare per ſingulos.</note> it.) 4. But all this is nothing to our preſent purpoſe; becauſe <hi>Euſebius</hi> could not <hi>readily</hi> tell <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Names</hi> of the Biſhops which had been before him, it doth not follow, that there had been no ſuch thing as a <hi>ſetled Epiſcopacy.</hi> For who can reaſonably expect, that there ſhould be an <hi>exact Regiſter</hi> of the Names of all the Biſhops in the World? Though in the Age <hi>next</hi> to the Apoſtles we find <hi>Ignatius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Dama</hi> of <hi>Magneſia,</hi> and <hi>Polybius</hi> at <hi>Trallis,</hi> and <hi>Papias</hi> of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> and <hi>Melito</hi> of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and <hi>Symeon</hi> (the Son of <hi>Cleophas)</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Palmeas</hi> of <hi>Amaſtris,</hi> and <hi>Thraſeas</hi> of <hi>Eumenia,</hi> and <hi>Sagaris</hi> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> yet 'tis not to be wondred at, if we meet not with the Names of many <hi>more,</hi> who preſided over other Churches in <hi>thoſe</hi> parts of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and yet 'tis eaſie to gather from <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> his Epiſtle to <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that all the <hi>Aſiatic</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Euſeb. Eccles, Hiſt. l. 5. c. 24.</note> Churches <hi>were under</hi> the Government of Epiſcopacy. Again, though in the <hi>ſame</hi> Age we find <hi>Pothinus</hi> to have been Biſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Denys</hi> the Areopagite of <hi>Athens,</hi> and another <hi>Denys</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who mentions <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gortina,</hi> and <hi>Pinytus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gnoſſus;</hi> I ſay,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41051:20"/>
though the Names of theſe and other Primitive Biſhops in the very <hi>next</hi> Century to the Apoſtles, do ſtill ſtand upon <hi>good</hi> Record, yet 'tis not <hi>modeſt, ingenuous,</hi> or <hi>reaſonable,</hi> for any Man to require us, either to nominate <hi>every</hi> one of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Succeſſors in <hi>all</hi> parts of the World, or to lay down our pretenſions of a <hi>ſetled</hi> Epiſcopacy in the Ages <hi>next</hi> to them; eſpecially ſince <hi>Ireneus</hi> hath told us, that <hi>he</hi> was able (though <note place="margin">Iren. ubi ſuprà. Idem affirmat Tertullianus, de Praeſc. Adv. Her.</note> we are not) to reckon up the Biſhops who ſucceeded the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in <hi>all</hi> the Churches. Were there no exact Liſt of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prelates of <hi>England,</hi> yet I hope it would <hi>not follow,</hi> that theſe Churches have not been all along under the Government of Epiſcopacy. It will trouble the <hi>beſt</hi> Antiquary to tell us all the old Biſhops among the ancient <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> and yet we know, that they had Biſhops before the <hi>Saxons</hi> came in hither (which was about <hi>Anno</hi> 450) and many Ages <hi>before</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> claimed <hi>any</hi> Juriſdiction in this Iſland.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But then <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> a Succeſſion of Biſhops in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Churches, nevertheleſs it is Objected, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is no ſufficient witneſs of a ſetled Epiſcopacy in the firſt Ages, becauſe the Ancients ſpeak <hi>ambiguouſly</hi> and <hi>doubtfully</hi> of thoſe Biſhops, calling them <hi>ſometimes</hi> Presbyters; ſo that we have no <hi>certain</hi> account, whether thoſe Men were <hi>ſuperiour</hi> to Presbyters in <hi>Order, Power,</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> or whether they were above them only in a <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> like the Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Aſſemblies, or like the <hi>Archontes</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and the <hi>Ephori</hi> at <hi>Sparta,</hi> who had an <hi>equal</hi> power, but gave a <hi>deference</hi> of Honour and Dignity to one above the reſt. Now, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder, that Men ſhould <hi>invent</hi> doubts where there are <hi>none:</hi> for nothing is more clear, then that the Biſhops thus ſucceeding the Apoſtles, had a Superiority of <hi>Power</hi> over the reſt of the Clergy, not only to <hi>ordain,</hi> but alſo to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>cenſure</hi> them, without any Authority <hi>given</hi> them by a <hi>Bench</hi> of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> though not always without their <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Advice.</hi> For the removing of this third Scruple then, theſe five things are to be noted. 1. That in many of the writers of the firſt and ſecond Age after Apoſtles, we find a <hi>plain diſtinction</hi> between

               <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> as <hi>three distinct</hi> Orders. 2. That in <hi>not one</hi> of theſe writers can we find, that this Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Biſhops over Presbyters was thought <hi>then</hi> (what ever was imagined in after-times) to be <hi>founded</hi> on any <hi>act, vote,</hi> or <hi>conſent</hi> of the Church, as <hi>beſtowing</hi> this Power upon them. 3. But on the contrary, that the care of all Eccleſiaſtical <note place="margin">Can.

               <hi>them their own Office, Power, and Authority.</hi> 4. Therefore, whereas it is alleaged, that a Father or two of that Age, do ſometimes comprehend Biſhops under the <hi>general</hi> Name of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, it is granted, that the <hi>Prelates</hi> were ſo <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>modeſt,</hi> as upon occaſion to ſtile themſelves <hi>Presbyters,</hi> thereby giving a deference of <hi>Honour</hi> to thoſe as were <hi>ſuch only.</hi> But yet they looked upon the <hi>Offices</hi> to be <hi>distinct;</hi> and ſaith St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi>

But fifthly, to put all out of doubt, we are beholding to a very <hi>Learned Prelate</hi> of our Church for <hi>Two uſeful</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vindic. Epiſt. Ignat. p. 2. c. 13.</note> Obſervations, which we may well take upon <hi>his Credit.</hi> Firſt, that no writer of that Age next to the Apoſtles did <hi>ſo promiſcuouſly</hi> uſe the Names of Biſhop and Presbyter, as to give
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41051:21"/>
the <hi>Name</hi> of Biſhop to one who was only a <hi>Presbyter</hi> of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Order. Though <hi>Biſhops</hi> were ſometimes called <hi>Presbyters</hi> (the <hi>greater</hi> Office <hi>including</hi> the <hi>leſs)</hi> yet that a <hi>bare Presbyter</hi> was ever then called a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> is <hi>not</hi> to be proved by any <hi>one</hi> inſtance out of the Monuments of thoſe times. Secondly, that no writer of that Age did ever give the Name of Presbyter to a Biſhop, when he <hi>reckoned up</hi> the Degrees and Orders of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and where he ſpake of <hi>ſome ſingle Miniſter then living.</hi> So that, as you ſhall <hi>never</hi> find a <hi>Presbyer</hi> called <hi>Biſhop,</hi> ſo you ſhall <hi>rarely</hi> find <hi>Biſhops</hi> called <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and where they <hi>are</hi> ſo, the writer mentioneth things in a <hi>lump,</hi> not <hi>counting</hi> up the Degrees <hi>orderly,</hi> nor ſpeaking of one ſingle perſon of his time.

            <p>By what has been briefly ſaid, it may appear to any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced perſon, that in the <hi>earlieſt</hi> and <hi>firſt</hi> times, when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was but <hi>green</hi> in the World, the Churches were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Government of Biſhops.</hi> We find innumerable inſtances of it in thoſe Churches planted by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>John,</hi> and other Apoſtles: We find in undoubted Monuments of the beſt Antiquity, the very <hi>Names</hi> mentioned of ſeveral Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Biſhops, who preſided over ſome Apoſtolical Churches, and a <hi>certain</hi> Succeſſion avowed of <hi>other</hi> Biſhops, in <hi>other</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whoſe particular Names do <hi>not</hi> occur: We find, that theſe Biſhops were then looked upon, as a <hi>diſtinct Order</hi> from the reſt of the Clergy, ſometimes called Biſhops in <hi>contra-diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to Presbyters, and <hi>always</hi> own'd as <hi>Superiour</hi> unto them, <hi>not</hi> by any Eccleſiaſtical conſent or grant for the avoiding of confuſion only, but by an <hi>Antecedent Charter,</hi> derived to them from the Apoſtles. All which do abundantly ſatisfie me of the Truth of that declaration of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>it is evident to all Men diligently reading Holy Scripture, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pref. to the form of making or ordaining</hi> Biſhops, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>ancient Authors, that from the Apoſtles time, there have been theſe Orders of Ministers in Chriſts Church, Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons.</hi> And in that our Church mentioneth the reading
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41051:21"/>
of Holy Scripture it is clear that <hi>in her account</hi> ſhe taketh in the very <hi>times of the Apoſtles,</hi> and meaneth, that from the Scripture it may be proved, that Epiſcopacy <hi>was erected</hi> while the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> were <hi>living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which ſhall give me warrant to take one ſtep more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the Age <hi>next</hi> to the Apoſtles, to the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Age it <hi>ſelf,</hi> and to affirm, that <hi>even then,</hi> there was ſuch a Sacred Order of men, as we now call <hi>properly, ſtrictly,</hi> and by way of <hi>eminence</hi> and <hi>diſtinction, Biſhops.</hi> Now, that we meet with the <hi>Name, frequently</hi> in our Tranſlation, and <hi>oftner</hi> in the Original, is altogether out of doubt. The grand Queſtion is about the thing, whether in <hi>thoſe</hi> days, the <hi>Office, Power,</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> was <hi>diſtinct</hi> from, and in any reſpect <hi>ſuperiour</hi> unto the <hi>Office, Power,</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of a Presbyter? And though the Sence and Practice of the ſucceeding Age, be enough to make us <hi>morally</hi> certain, that it was ſo (becauſe it cannot be reaſonably ſuppos'd, that men ſo haraſſed by Perſecution, ſo zealous for Truth and Honeſty, and ſo careful to obſerve the Apoſtles orders (even in the <hi>leaſt</hi> things) <hi>could</hi> or <hi>would</hi> conſpire together to make an <hi>univerſal</hi> defection from ſo <hi>main</hi> a part of Chriſtianity, as the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church is;) yet ſetting aſide that conſideration, to me it ſeemeth obvious and certain, that Chriſt, the <hi>great Biſhop of our Souls, erected</hi> an Epiſcopal Power, and that the Apoſtles <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>propagated</hi> it (I mean ſtill a Power, above that belonging to Presbyters;) This I ſhall endeavour briefly to ſhew; 1. By making good the <hi>Affirmative;</hi> and then, Secondly, By clearing up thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which are uſually brought from Scripture to prove the <hi>Negative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For probation of Epiſcopacy, we begin with the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the <hi>Twelve Apostles,</hi> which evidently <hi>differ'd</hi> from the Miſſion of the Seventy two Diſciples, in whom 'tis concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Office and Power of <hi>Presbyters</hi> was founded. Now the <hi>Twelve Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>indeed Biſhops,</hi> though they were not clenched to any <hi>particular Sees</hi> and <hi>Chairs,</hi> which the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41051:22"/>
of thoſe times would not give way to. For the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this, it is obſervable, that the Miſſion of the Twelve Apoſtles (as to their <hi>own Perſons)</hi> was extraordinary, and that which none could pretend to in following Ages; becauſe they were ſent <hi>immediately</hi> by Chriſt himſelf, and had a <hi>common</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and care over all the Churches that ſhould be, and were endowed with a Power of working <hi>Miracles,</hi> to confirm the Truth of their Doctrin: But then their Authority and Charge (as to their <hi>Function)</hi> was an <hi>ordinary,</hi> and <hi>standing Power,</hi> that was not to dye with them, nor to ceaſe (as Miracles did) after a little interval, but ſuch as was to be <hi>tranſmitted</hi> to others from time to time, and ſo to <hi>continue</hi> to the Worlds end. Now, if it doth appear, Firſt, that the <hi>Twelve</hi> had a <hi>Superiour power</hi> over Presbyters; Secondly, that this Power was to be <hi>imparted</hi> and <hi>communicated</hi> to their Succeſſors <hi>for ever;</hi> Thirdly, that this was no other than the <hi>Ordinary Epiſcopal</hi> Power: Then this will ſuffice to ſhew, that the Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were truly and indeed Biſhops, in their <hi>ordinary capacity;</hi> and conſequently, that Epiſcopal Power was erected in <hi>their</hi> Time. Firſt, then, That the Twelve Apoſtles had a <hi>Superior</hi> power over Presbyters, appeareth not only from the <hi>Extent</hi> of their Commiſſion, which compared with that given to the Seventy two <hi>Diſciples,</hi> was much <hi>larger,</hi> (for <hi>as the Father ſent</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

They <hi>Ordained Matthias,</hi> and took <note place="margin">

               <hi>delivered unto Satan,</hi> by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> after that he was ordained an Apoſtle. This is enough to ſhew the Superiority of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20.</note> power. 2. Again; This power of theirs was <hi>no Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary</hi> thing, that was to vaniſh with their breath, but that which was to be <hi>communicated</hi> to others, to be <hi>tranſmitted</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Poſterity, and to <hi>hold</hi> as long as there ſhould be <hi>need</hi> of it, that is, as long as the <hi>World</hi> ſhould hold. For ſo the promiſe of Chriſt runs, <hi>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 20.</note> 
               <hi>the World.</hi> Here our Lord did engage, not to be with their <hi>Perſons</hi> alone (for they were to dye within a ſhort time,) but to be with their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> too; that is, to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> their Function for ever. (And truly, had not Chriſt aſſiſted it <hi>marvellouſly,</hi> it would have <hi>fallen</hi> e're now, ſince it hath been ſo <hi>luſtily beav'd</hi> at, eſpecially in theſe laſt Ages.) 'Tis plain, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our intended, that the Apoſtles power ſhould <hi>continue</hi> to the Worlds end; I mean, their <hi>Ordinary power,</hi> which was for the <hi>Regiment</hi> of the Church. For, their <hi>Extraordinary power,</hi> of ſpeaking all Languages, and working Miracles (which was for the <hi>Planting</hi> of the Church) was not to laſt <hi>long,</hi> but to <hi>ceaſe</hi> after a while: So that it was their <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>ſtanding</hi> power, to <hi>Adminiſter Sacraments,</hi> to <hi>Preach,</hi> to <hi>Govern,</hi> to <hi>Ordain,</hi> and to <hi>exerciſe the power of the Keys,</hi> this was that which was to <hi>hold,</hi> to be <hi>delivered</hi> and <hi>banded</hi> down from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Generation. Now, if there be any <hi>truth</hi> in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt, this <hi>Apoſtolic Power</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> doth <hi>laſt,</hi> and <hi>ſtill continue,</hi> and is even at <hi>this hour</hi> in the World. 3. Thirdly then, this Power we ſpeak of is really <hi>that</hi> which we now call <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> The Apoſtles Function, is <hi>part</hi> of it in <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> more of it in <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> of it in <hi>Biſhops;</hi> there the <hi>whole Ordinary power centers,</hi> and is <hi>united.</hi> The Twelve were called (as their immediate <hi>Succeſſors</hi> were many times alſo called) <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in reſpect of their <hi>Miſſion</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but in reſpect of their <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Inſpection</hi> over Chriſt's <hi>Church,</hi> they were <hi>indeed Biſhops.</hi> They were the <hi>firſt poſſeſſors</hi> of Epiſcopacy; and the Biſhops now are their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtolate.</hi> 'Tis plain that they themſelves, and the Church following them, underſtood them to be no more than Biſhops,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41051:23"/>
in their <hi>ordinary capacity.</hi> For, as on the <hi>one</hi> hand, many <hi>Biſhops,</hi> beſides the <hi>firſt Twelve,</hi> were called <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (ſo, <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Which thing had it been well heeded, might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſome Learned Tracts, which have been written againſt the <hi>Divine Right of Epiſcopacy.</hi> For, to determin, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ordained <hi>not</hi> Epiſcopacy, ſeemeth to me to be an <hi>Affirmation,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:41051:23"/>
that He ordained <hi>not</hi> Apoſtles; for they were inveſted with that <hi>Epiſcopal power,</hi> which, God be bleſſed, hath continued in the Church hitherto, notwithſtanding all the <hi>gainſayings of Core.</hi> Now this conſideration leadeth us on to the next; <hi>viz.</hi> That as the Apoſtles <hi>received</hi> this power <hi>themſelves,</hi> ſo it is proveable out of their Writings, that they <hi>imparted</hi> it to <hi>others,</hi> and inveſted <hi>them</hi> with their <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Authority. To ſhew this, I ſhall make choice of three ſpecial Inſtances, and they are theſe. 1. Firſt, though the Scripture doth not expreſly <hi>&amp; totidem verbis</hi> tell us, that St. <hi>James</hi> was <hi>Biſhop of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V. Grot. in ep.</hi> Ja.</note> 
               <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet that he <hi>was ſo,</hi> we are as certain as the moſt Ancient Records can make us. And indeed St. <hi>Luke</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Apoſtles Acts, doth yield us ſuch <hi>fair probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of this thing, that the Teſtimonies of ſucceeding times ſeem to be <hi>unqueſtionably</hi> True. For in <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 18. we read, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was returned from his Circuit to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the next day, he and his company went in unto <hi>James,</hi> and all the <hi>Elders</hi> were preſent. Now certainly, <hi>James</hi> would not have been named <hi>diſtinctly and by himſelf,</hi> had he not had a <hi>preheminence</hi> over the <hi>College of Elders</hi> that were aſſembled with him. St. <hi>Luke ſingles</hi> him out, as the Perſon to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> did after a <hi>particular</hi> manner addreſs himſelf; though all the Elders were there preſent, yet they went in unto <hi>James;</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating plainly, that he was the <hi>Preſident</hi> over that venerable Society. And to confirm this, it is likewiſe obſervable what is related of this St. <hi>James,</hi> at the famous Convention at <hi>Jeruſalem, Act.</hi> 15. The occaſion of that Synod, was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, about the <hi>Neceſſity and Uſe of Circumciſion,</hi> and great diſputes there were about it at the Council. But at laſt, when <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt, had given their <hi>Opinions</hi> of the matter, St. <hi>James determins</hi> it, and puts an end to the debate by his <hi>deciſive Sentence,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>—I determine, Judge, and give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> ſaith he, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. and in his Judgement and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all did <hi>acquieſce.</hi> This is a plain Argument, that St. <hi>James</hi> was then Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For otherwiſe, why did St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo <hi>particularly</hi> apply himſelf to St. <hi>James?</hi> and why did the <hi>other</hi> Apoſtles (and even <hi>Peter himſelf)</hi> reſt in the <hi>Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41051:24"/>

He was to allot a double Portion (of <note place="margin">c. 4.—12.</note> maintenance) to Elders, that Ruled well (under him) and <note place="margin">c. 5.—17.</note> laboured in the Word.

The <hi>third</hi> inſtance to ſhew, that the Apoſtles ſetled the Epiſcopal form of Government, is <hi>Titus,</hi> whom <hi>Antiquity</hi> acknowledgeth to have been <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan of Crete,</hi> (an Iſland, conſiſtng of an hundred Cities) and to have been intruſted with the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling</hi> and <hi>Governing</hi> of all the Churches there. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> left him there, is clear from his own words; and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5.</note> queſtionleſs, his deſign was, that <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould <hi>remain</hi> and <hi>continue</hi> there, unleſs ſummoned away upon ſome Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and for a Time <hi>only;</hi> and even then St. <hi>Paul</hi> promiſed to ſend either <hi>Artemas,</hi> or <hi>Tychicus,</hi> to be his Vicar and Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator <note place="margin">c. 3.—12.</note> in his abſence. Now, that <hi>Titus</hi> was indeed a <hi>Biſhop, ſuperior</hi> in <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and inveſted with a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> over all his Clergy, doth plainly appear, from the Authority he had both to <hi>Ordain</hi> and to <hi>Judge</hi> of ſo many <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> declares he had. For this cauſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> Hom. in Tit. 1.</note> it was, that when the Apoſtle himſelf could not ſtay in <hi>Crete,</hi> to put every thing into due Order, but was obliged
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41051:25"/>
to be gone, he left <hi>Titus</hi> behind him, to <hi>ſet in order the things that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5, 11. &amp;c. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>were wanting,</hi> (and unſettled at S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s departure;) to <hi>ordain Biſhops,</hi> and to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of them into Cities, (into every City <hi>one;)</hi> to provide againſt the <hi>heterodox</hi> Preaching of Deceivers, to <hi>ſtop their mouths,</hi> to <hi>ſilence</hi> them, and to <hi>rebuke</hi> them ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to <hi>admoniſh</hi> Hereticks once and again, and then to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi> them upon their Contumacy. This was <hi>Titus</hi> his Office; and this was plainly the Exerciſe of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Power and Juriſdiction. And to confirm this further two things are obſervable: Firſt, that this Authority was given to <hi>Titus alone,</hi> not to a <hi>College of Presbyters,</hi> (which 'tis preſumable S. <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed before his going away) but to <hi>Titus ſingly;</hi> for this cauſe left I <hi>thee</hi> in <hi>Crete</hi> that <hi>thou</hi> ſhouldeſt <hi>ſet things in order,</hi> that <hi>thou</hi> ſhouldeſt <hi>ordain, &amp;c.</hi> This argues a <hi>ſupreme</hi> and a <hi>ſole</hi> Superintendency and Authority in <hi>Titus.</hi> Secondly, that there was a <hi>neceſſity</hi> for S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s committing this Authority unto him; for otherwiſe the things that were wanting could not be <hi>ſet in order,</hi> nor could Ordinations or Cenſures be there: for <hi>this</hi> cauſe left I thee in <hi>Crete.</hi> Which is a manifeſt Argument, that the Presbyters in <hi>Crete</hi> had no power either to <hi>ordain,</hi> or to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate,</hi> or to do <hi>ſuch acts of Juriſdiction;</hi> for then why was <hi>Titus</hi> left to thoſe purpoſes? And yet we ſee S. <hi>Paul</hi> left him, and for <hi>this cauſe</hi> left him; ſo that unleſs we will offer violence to the Sence of Scripture, we muſt confeſs that <hi>Titus</hi> was left and fix'd at <hi>Crete,</hi> as <hi>Biſhop and Metropolitan</hi> of the whole Iſland.</p>
            <p>To theſe three Apoſtolical Biſhops I might add many more, <note place="margin">Conſt. Apoſt. l. 7. c. <gap reason="foreign">

2. Having done then with the Proof of the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> I proceed next with what brevity I can, to anſwer that <hi>grand</hi> Argument, uſually brought to make good the <hi>Negative, viz.</hi> that the <hi>Names</hi> of Biſhop and Presbyter are <hi>indifferently</hi> and <hi>promiſcuouſly</hi> uſed in the Apoſtolical Writings, as if onely <hi>one</hi> Order of men were meant by them. As for inſtance, in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2, 5. <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Titus,</hi> that <hi>he left him in Crete,</hi> as for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo for this, that he ſhould Ordain <hi>Elders</hi> (or <hi>Presbyters)</hi> in every City. Then <hi>ver.</hi> 6. he layeth down the Qualifications of theſe Elders; and (as a reaſon for it) he ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 7. for a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> muſt be blameleſs, &amp;c. Here a Biſhop and a Presbyter ſeem to be, <hi>not two</hi> diſtinct Orders, but <hi>one and the ſame;</hi> and ſo ſome ſay, that by a <hi>Presbyter</hi> is here meant a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> and others affirm, that by a <hi>Biſhop</hi> is here meant a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and hence are willing to conclude, that in the Apoſtles time they were <hi>not</hi> thought to be <hi>two diſtinct</hi> Offices, but <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> to be <hi>one,</hi> both in <hi>Name, Order,</hi> and <hi>Authority:</hi> and ſo <hi>Prelacy</hi> muſt fall to the ground, without any help from <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the removing of this Difficulty three things are to be obſerved: 1. That <hi>Aerius</hi> the Heretic was the <hi>firſt</hi> that ever <hi>found out,</hi> or <hi>inſiſted on,</hi> this Community and Identity of <hi>Names;</hi> for the Writers <hi>before</hi> him (in the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond</hi> Age after the Apoſtles) did not diſcourſe at <hi>this</hi> rate, could not <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover</hi> ſuch a <hi>promiſcuous</hi> uſe of the words. 2. The Catholick Writers <hi>after Aerius,</hi> who thought as he did, that the <hi>Names</hi> of Biſhop and Presbyter were common in the Apoſtles days; did not yet think, as that Heretic did affirm, that the <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> were ever the <hi>ſame.</hi> No; they held, that though <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> were ſometimes called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters Biſhops,</hi> yet Biſhops were a rank of Miniſters <hi>above</hi> Presbyters both in <hi>Degree</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> even in the Age of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> 3. But then there is one Obſervation more, for which I muſt thank a very <hi>Learned Prelate</hi> of our Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <note place="margin">Vindic. Epiſt. Ignat. p. 184.</note> this Conſtruction and late Pretence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41051:26"/>
uſe of the words, yet it doth not appear, that the Scripture gives the Titles of Biſhop and Presbyter <hi>indifferently</hi> and <hi>promiſcuouſly</hi> to thoſe of <hi>both</hi> Orders. There is no <hi>neceſſity</hi> for us to <hi>admit</hi> of a <hi>community of Names,</hi> becauſe thoſe places which ſeem to <hi>infer</hi> this Community may be <hi>fairly understood,</hi> though we do <hi>appropriate</hi> the name of Biſhop to a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and the name of Presbyter to a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> This will appear from a particular view of the ſeveral Texts; which if we can underſtand <hi>without</hi> being obliged to <hi>confound</hi> Names, then farwell that <hi>grand</hi> Principle, which the <hi>Claſſical Divines</hi> have taken for granted, and which is the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>ſole</hi> Argument to prove a <hi>parity and equality of power</hi> among all Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, above the Degree of Deacons. One famous place alleag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 17. there S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſends to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and calls the <hi>Elders</hi> (or Presbyters) of the Church to him at <hi>Miletus;</hi> and then he ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you</hi>

               <hi>overſeers,</hi> or (as it <hi>ſhould</hi> be rendered) <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Here (ſay they) the <hi>Names</hi> of Presbyters and Biſhops is given to the <hi>ſame</hi> men, and ſo the <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of theſe men was the <hi>ſame.</hi> But I pray, my Maſters, why ſo? What <hi>neceſſity</hi> is there for this poſitive Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion? Were <hi>none</hi> with S. <hi>Paul</hi> at this time <hi>but</hi> Presbyters? Yes, <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived near the Apoſtles time, will tell you, <note place="margin">Iren. adv. Haer. l. 1. c. 14.</note> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> called together <hi>both Biſhops and Presbyters.</hi> Were none there but the Clergy of the City of <hi>Epheſus?</hi> Yes, the ſame ancient Writer tells you, <hi>that the Clergy of all the Cities round about were there too; In Mileto convocatis Epiſcopis &amp; Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteris, qui erant ab Epheſo, &amp; à reliquis proximis civit atibus—</hi>The <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> were called from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and from <hi>other neighbouring</hi> Cities. And indeed S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words do inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thus much; for ſaith he <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Ye know from the firſt day I tame into Aſia, after what manner I have been with you at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> Now S. <hi>Paul</hi> had been with the Biſhops and Presbyters of <hi>other</hi> Cities in <hi>Aſia</hi> beſides <hi>Epheſus;</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſpeaking to <hi>them,</hi> and appealing to <hi>their</hi> Knowledge of his Behaviour, doth plainly argue, that <hi>they</hi> were with him now; and that this Convention did conſiſt of <hi>very many of the Aſiatic Biſhops and</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41051:26"/>
               <hi>Presbyters.</hi> There is then neither <hi>neceſſity</hi> nor <hi>reaſon</hi> to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that onely the inferiour ſort of Clergy appeared at the Apoſtle's Summons; much leſs that he ſhould call them Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. Rather it is preſumable, that as he ſpake to <hi>all in general,</hi> ſo that he directed his ſpeech <hi>chiefly</hi> to the moſt <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> part of that Reverend Aſſembly, and that he called them <hi>Biſhops</hi> who were ſo in truth, and told <hi>them</hi> that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt had made them Biſhops</hi> over their reſpective Charges, ſo addreſſing himſelf <hi>immediately and more particularly</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> whoſe Office it was to ſuperintend the Flock of Chriſt, and to obviate the Incurſion of Wolves. And thus this place may be fairly underſtood, without <hi>confounding of Names,</hi> without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violence to <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or without robbing the Biſhops, to give their Title and Honour unto Presbyters; becauſe it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to conceive, that the Apoſtle convened Biſhops and Presbyters too, and ſpake <hi>directly and immediately</hi> to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, (of whom 'tis likely that <hi>Timothy</hi> was the chief;) and to the reſt <hi>accommodating</hi> himſelf <hi>collaterally, ſecundarily,</hi> and by <note place="margin">Grot. in loc.</note> way of <hi>reflexion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another place which has been hotly urged in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, is that mentioned before in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. where <hi>Titus</hi> is left in <hi>Crete—</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that he might <hi>conſtitute Presbyters city by city, if any were blameleſs, the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of one wife—for a biſhop muſt be blameleſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Now they who accuſe Biſhops as <hi>Corah</hi> did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> for <hi>taking too much upon them,</hi> triumph mightily <note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> from <hi>this</hi> Text, as if the <hi>Names</hi> of Biſhop and Presbyter were clearly <hi>ſynonimous.</hi> But upon due examination we find, that the Apoſtle's Sence doth not at all carry it this way, much leſs is there a <hi>neceſſity</hi> for us to underſtand him after <hi>this</hi> manner. For all that S. <hi>Paul</hi> requires of <hi>Titus</hi> here, ſeemeth to be <hi>this,</hi> that he would <hi>advance</hi> the Presbyters which were under him, and <hi>ordain them Biſhops,</hi> and diſpoſe of them into Cities, fixing each of them to a certain Cure: that is, ſuch of them as were <hi>approved</hi> men; for a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs. This Sence is eaſie, and the thing is probable. For queſtionleſs there were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41051:27"/>
many Presbyters now in <hi>Crete,</hi> (whether ordain'd by S. <hi>Paul before</hi> his departure, or by <hi>Titus</hi> himſelf <hi>afterwards,</hi> I will not diſpute; but many Presbyters there were) it being impoſſible for <hi>Titus</hi> to take a due care of ſo conſiderable an Iſland with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Aſſiſtants. 'Tis likely therefore, that when S. <hi>Paul</hi> was going away, either he left Presbyters behind him, or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain ſome, to take <hi>part</hi> of his burthen; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him not to prefer them <hi>hastily,</hi> but to <hi>prove</hi> them firſt, and then to <hi>ordain</hi> them <hi>Biſhops,</hi> having made ſufficient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of their Abilities and Fitneſs for ſo great a Truſt. And in this Epiſtle ſent to him from <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> he minds him of that which he order'd him before, <hi>viz.</hi> that upon <hi>proof and tryal</hi> made of his Presbyters, he ſhould <hi>promote</hi> them, and <hi>ſet them over Cities,</hi> (over every City one;) <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs.</hi> So that according to this eaſie and fair Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there can be no pretence of any <hi>confuſion</hi> of Names; becauſe the Apoſtle doth not mean that <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould take Deacons or Laymen into the Order of Presbyters, but that he ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſuch as were <hi>Presbyters already</hi> into the ſuperiour Order of <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and having firſt <hi>conſecrated and ordained</hi> them, to aſſign each of them his Dioceſe and City, that they might be inveſted with their <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Authority and Juriſdiction too. And this ſeems to be that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>Conſtitution or Promotion of Presbyters,</hi> which the Apoſtle requireth here.</p>
            <p>Other places there are, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of Biſhops and Deacons <hi>only,</hi> without taking notice of an <hi>intermediate</hi> rank of Clergy; as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. he gives inſtructions for the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Biſhops and Deacons:</hi> And in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. he ſaluteth the Saints at <hi>Philippi,</hi> with the <hi>Biſhops and Deacons.</hi> Whence the Adverſaries of Epiſcopacy do conclude, that by <hi>Biſhops</hi> there, <hi>Presbyters</hi> are intended; otherwiſe we muſt ſuppoſe them to be paſt over wholly, which is not to be conceived the Apoſtle would do. But by their good leave, I do aſſert, that where the Apoſtle mentioneth <hi>Biſhops,</hi> he ever meaneth ſuch as are <hi>truly and properly Biſhops,</hi> not including Presbyters under that <hi>Notion.</hi> And for the clearing of the Objection, three things are obſervable.</p>

And thirdly, that the neceſſities and condition of places were ſuch in the beginning, that all Churches were not ſo <hi>compleatly</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> modelled at the <hi>firſt,</hi> as they were in <hi>proceſs</hi> of time. For, as Churches were <hi>greater</hi> or leſs in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, ſo were Church-Officers <hi>more</hi> or <hi>fewer</hi> in number. Where the multitude of Chriſtians was not great, there a Biſhop and his Deacon were enough to diſcharge the work of the Miniſtry: where the numbers of Chriſtians did increaſe, there Presbyters were appointed to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> the Biſhop, and to act <hi>under</hi> him: and where an Apoſtle thought good not to fix <hi>any</hi> Biſhop, but to hold the Government of a Church <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in his own hands,</hi> there he did commonly appoint a <hi>College</hi> or <hi>Bench</hi> of Presbyters to perform Miniſterial Offices, as his <hi>Proxies</hi> in his abſence, and <hi>by his Authority</hi> derived and <hi>delegated</hi> unto them: For ſo did St. <hi>Paul</hi> keep the Superintendency over the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in his <hi>own</hi> hands, as their <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>ſole</hi> Biſhop, becauſe he had converted them to the Faith; and what the Presbyters did in excommunicating that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous perſon, they did it by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Spirit, that is, by <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 4.</note> his Epiſcopal <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> committed unto him by Chriſt: <hi>I verily as abſent in Body, but preſent in Spirit (or by my Authority) have judged already concerning him,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. This Obſervation will give us to underſtand the meaning <note place="margin">Epiph. haeres. 75.</note>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:41051:28"/>
of that which we collect out of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that <hi>in one Church there were Biſhops and Deacons only, (where the numbers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts were ſmall) in another there were Presbyters without any Biſhops,</hi> beſides an Apoſtle <hi>(where there was need of many Miniſters, and yet one could not be found that was ſo fit for the Biſhoprick:) in others agen there were Biſhops, Presbyters, and Deacons too</hi> (where the condition of the place did require it, and the worth and abilities of the Men did admit of it.) Now then to come to the Objection. St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives <hi>Timothy</hi> an <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.</note> account of the Qualifications neceſſary in Biſhops; and this queſtionleſs was in order to their Ordination. But how doth it appear, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> are meant by the word <hi>Biſhops?</hi> Were <hi>Presbyters</hi> now to be <hi>Ordained?</hi> Did the word of God <note place="margin">Act. 19. 20.</note> grow and prevail ſo mightily in the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Churches, and yet <hi>no Presbyters</hi> in them? Was St. <hi>Paul</hi> among them for the <hi>ſpace of three years, preaching, diſputing, and converting ſo many</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 20. 31.</note> Multitudes to the Faith, and yet ordained <hi>no Presbyters</hi> to water what he had ſo proſperouſly planted? And if Presbyters <hi>were</hi> ordained were <hi>ſetled</hi> in the Churches of <hi>Epheſus</hi> before the Apoſtles departure to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> what neceſſity was there for him to ſend his Son <hi>Timothy</hi> Inſtructions concerning the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Presbyters,</hi> eſpecially when he hoped to <hi>return</hi> unto him <hi>ſhortly?</hi> Divines conceive that this Epiſtle was ſent by <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 14.</note> him ſoon after he departed from <hi>Epheſus:</hi> and were all the Presbyters dead in that <hi>little</hi> time? 'Tis hardly to be believed, that Presbyters were <hi>wanting:</hi> but Biſhops were. For hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to St. <hi>Paul</hi> had been with the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> for the moſt part, in his <hi>own</hi> perſon; he had governed them in his <hi>own</hi> perſon; and had exerciſed his Epiſcopal Authority in his <hi>own</hi> perſon: But now he was gone, leaving <hi>Timothy</hi> in his room; he was the firſt Biſhop that was fixt at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the only Biſhop indeed now; and yet but a young Man, that had need of other Biſhops to <hi>concur</hi> with him, and <hi>help</hi> him in his Office, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was uncertain when he ſhould ſee him <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> again, there was an urgent <hi>neceſſity</hi> for him to write ſpeedily to his Son, that <hi>other</hi> Biſhops might be <hi>ordained,</hi> that other Churches might be guarded from the <hi>Gnoſtic</hi> Seducers, as well
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41051:28"/>
as <hi>Epheſus</hi> it ſelf, the great Metropolis. There is no neceſſity then for us to conceive, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> did mean Presbyters when he ſpake of Biſhops; but rather that he gave directions for the Ordination of <hi>thoſe,</hi> who were to be <hi>Biſhops indeed,</hi> to be inveſted with Epiſcopal Power, and to preſide over other Cities, as <hi>Timothy</hi> did over <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s own Chair.</p>
            <p>Again; the Apoſtle ſaluteth the Saints at <hi>Philippi,</hi> with the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons, Phil.</hi> 1. 1. But there is <hi>no Demonſtrative</hi> Reaſon to conſtrain, nor <hi>probable Argument</hi> to induce us to believe, that he directed his ſalutation to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> much leſs, that he gave them the Title of <hi>Biſhops.</hi> For, there are ſeveral fair accounts to be given of this matter: either (as ſome conceive) that there were two Biſhops over two Churches in <hi>Philippi</hi> (Jewiſh, and Gentile Chriſtians) as 'twas uſual in other places: or (as others are of Opinion) that the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Biſhops were now aſſembled at <hi>Philippi,</hi> as 'twas uſual at other times: or (as others are perſuaded) that the Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſent not <hi>to,</hi> but <hi>from</hi> the Biſhops and Deacons; and ſo the words are to be read <hi>thus</hi> with a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Timotheus <hi>the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt (to all the Saints in Chriſt Jeſus, which are at</hi> Philippi) <hi>with the Biſhops and Deacons;</hi> Grace be unto you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But which way ſoever we interpret the Text, we are ſo far from finding <hi>any Presbyters</hi> in the Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that there is no argument to prove, that they were <hi>at all</hi> in the City whither the Salutation was ſent. For <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us, that many Churches at the firſt were ordered by Biſhops and Deacons <hi>only:</hi> and then, why not the Churches of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Thus their whole Argument fails them, who would prove the Office and Order of Biſhop and Presbyter to have been the ſame in the Apoſtles days, becauſe forſooth the <hi>Name</hi> is given to <hi>both</hi> in Scripture. Though the Conſequence would <hi>not</hi> be good, ſhould their grand Principle be <hi>granted,</hi> yet there is no ſolid reaſon for us to grant the <hi>Principle it ſelf.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not ſtick to conclude peremptorily, That the Order of Biſhops, both as to <hi>name</hi> and <hi>thing,</hi> is ſo far from being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> or an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Ordinance,</hi> that it was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41051:29"/>
               <hi>inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf,</hi> and <hi>founded</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of Chriſt, and <hi>by them ſo eſtabliſh'd</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> in all the Churches of Chriſt, that for 1500 years together no Church in the world, being <hi>perfectly and rightly form'd,</hi> was ever under any other ſort of Government: but that the Epiſcopal Office and Authority hath through a continual Succeſſion of Ages been communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, tranſmitted, and handed down to the whole Catholick Church, even from the moſt <hi>primitive</hi> and <hi>infant times</hi> of Chriſtianity: and conſequently, that this way of Government, ſtill retained and defended in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the <hi>old and the good way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, <hi>Aerius</hi> was the firſt man that ever durſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that a Biſhop is not above a Presbyter in Power, Order, and Authority: but he was counted a <hi>mad man</hi> for his pains, and was ranked by the Church in the black Catalogue of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> not onely for his <hi>Separation</hi> from the Catholick Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, nor onely for his condemning of <hi>Catholick Cuſtoms,</hi> nor onely for embracing the Heretical Sentiments of <hi>Arius,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for <hi>affirming,</hi> that <hi>Presbyters were of equal power and authority with Biſhops.</hi> And yet I much queſtion, whether he ſpake his <hi>free opinion,</hi> or onely ſaid ſo out of <hi>envy and ſpight to Euſtathius.</hi> For <hi>Aerius</hi> would fain have been a Biſhop <hi>himſelf,</hi> but <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> ſtood in his way; and for that reaſon he grew <hi>ſullen, dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> and <hi>envious:</hi> and ſuch men commonly vend ſome <hi>new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> to be revenged for their <hi>diſappointments;</hi> and ſo did he this: becauſe he had not Merits enough to <hi>advance</hi> himſelf from a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> he had it ſeems <hi>impudence</hi> enough to <hi>degrade a Biſhop</hi> into a <hi>Presbyter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not make any untoward Reflections upon thoſe <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Aerius,</hi> who in theſe our days have greatly <hi>wounded</hi> Chriſtianity by the ſame <hi>groundleſs and ſingular,</hi> but <hi>confident</hi> Aſſertion. Yet I think 'tis no uncharitableneſs to wiſh for the Peace and Intereſt of Chriſtendom, that their <hi>tallons</hi> were well <hi>pared,</hi> who are not content to ſcratch and deface the <hi>Walls of the Church,</hi> unleſs they undermine the very <hi>pillars</hi> of it too; thoſe ancient and ſtrong Pillars, upon which the Church hath reſted, and by which Religion has been <hi>upheld</hi> even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41051:29"/>
2. Having ſaid thus much touching the Antiquity of <hi>our form of Government,</hi> I proceed now to that, which is <hi>another</hi> moſt <hi>material</hi> part of our Eſtabliſhments, that is, the <hi>form of our Service-book,</hi> or <hi>Liturgy.</hi> Concerning which I will be bold to affirm, and be bound to maintain againſt all parties what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that whoſoever doth either <hi>deprave,</hi> or <hi>diſ-eſteem</hi> it, muſt of neceſſity be either a very <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or a very <hi>naughty</hi> perſon. Very <hi>Ignorant</hi> if he doth not ſee, that our Service is ſo correſpondent to that of the <hi>Ancient</hi> Churches, that no Church in Chriſtendom this day can ſhew a more lively Monument of Antiquity, than our Common-Prayer Book. But a very <hi>naughty</hi> perſon, if ſeeing and knowing this, he doth preſume yet to condemn it; becauſe he cannot in this reſpect condemn the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but he muſt likewiſe condem all the Old Churches in the World; which, whether it be not an Argument of an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian</hi> and <hi>naughty</hi> Spirit, I leave to all moderate men to Judge.</p>
            <p>I am apt to hope, that thoſe calumnies and reproaches which our Liturgy hath been laden with, have been occaſioned by mens <hi>Ignorance</hi> of its excellencies. And therefore, to prevent thoſe aſperſions for the future (if it be poſſible) I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew. Firſt, the Antiquity of ſet forms of publick Prayer, in <hi>general.</hi> Secondly then, the Antiquity of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Liturgy, in <hi>particular.</hi> And when theſe two things be made to appear, I hope the Church of <hi>England</hi> will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted in <hi>this reſpect,</hi> as following the <hi>Old way</hi> of ſerving God.</p>
            <p>1. Touching the Ancient uſe of ſet Forms of publick Prayer, in <hi>general,</hi> three things are proveable, for the ſatisfaction of all <hi>Modeſt</hi> and <hi>Ingenuous</hi> People. 1. That <hi>ſet Forms</hi> of Divine Service were uſed among the Ancient <hi>Jews.</hi> 2. That <hi>ſet Forms</hi> of Divine Service were uſed alſo among the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians.</hi> 3. That after our bleſſed Lords Aſcention, in that <hi>interval</hi> between the <hi>Burial</hi> of the Synagogue, and the <hi>ſetling</hi> of the Chriſtian Church; ſet Forms of Divine Service were allowed alſo, even by the <hi>Holy Apoſtles.</hi> Theſe three Heads I ſhall inſiſt on, the more largely and particularly, becauſe they may ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and ſatisfie many (even <hi>prejudiced)</hi> perſons, who have not ſearched into the bottom of things, but have contented
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41051:30"/>
themſelves with many <hi>ſuperficial</hi> (not to ſay, <hi>groundleſs</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent)</hi> Notions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt then, it is manifeſt, that the <hi>whole Body</hi> of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice among the Jews, did conſiſt of ſeveral <hi>Preſcript and ſet Forms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At their Temple; though a great part of their Service was <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Typical,</hi> conſiſting of divers kinds of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and offerings, which in the fulneſs of time were to be done away; yet this was attended with <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Services, conſiſting of <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> which were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever. For, the <hi>Levites,</hi> whoſe office it was <hi>to ſtand every morning to thank and praiſe the Lord, and likewiſe at the Evening,</hi> were wont to perform their parts, as with a world of <note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 30.</note> ſolemnity, ſo alſo with Hymns and Songs, that were <hi>compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>ſet</hi> to their hands. Moſt of theſe were <hi>Pſalms</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by <hi>David;</hi> ſome were framed by <hi>Aſaph,</hi> and other <hi>Prophets;</hi> and all were put together into a Book, out of which the Levites were appointed, in the Name of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to worſhip and praiſe God in one of the outward Courts of the Temple, while the Sacrifices were offering by the Prieſt within. Hence it is, that we find many <hi>Pſalms</hi> directed to the <hi>chief Muſitian;</hi> for Tunes to be ſet unto them, that the Sons of <hi>Jeduthun, Korah,</hi> and other <hi>Levites</hi> in their courſes might ſing them in <hi>Conſort,</hi> with <hi>wind Inſtruments,</hi> and <hi>ſtringed Inſtruments</hi> (of which there were divers kinds, as <hi>Flutes, Cornets, Trumpets, Cymbals, Harps, Pſalteries,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>according to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, by his Prophets,</hi> 2 Chron. 29. 25. And hence it is too, that we find ſome <hi>Pſalms</hi> framed on purpoſe to be uſed on ſome <hi>ſpecial occaſion;</hi> as particularly, the 92 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> entituled, <hi>a Song for the Sabbath day;</hi> which was intended, queſtionleſs, to be ſung ſolemnly on the Sabbath, in memory of Gods reſt upon that day, and to give him thanks for his wonderful works of Creation and Providence. And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> hence it is, that the fifteen <hi>Pſalms</hi> immediately following the Hundred and Ninetenth, are called <hi>Pſalms of Degrees,</hi> or ſteps; becauſe the <hi>Levites</hi> were wont to ſing them upon the fifteen Stairs (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each Stair, one) which were between the womens and the mens Court. Briefly; we find it ſaid expreſly of King <hi>Hezikiah,</hi> that he <hi>commanded the Levites to ſing praiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:41051:30"/>
               <hi>the Lord with the words of David, and of Aſaph the Seer.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 30. So that it ſeemeth to be without queſtion, that all Acts of Divine Worſhip done by the <hi>Levites,</hi> were performed in <hi>Preſcript,</hi> and <hi>ſet forms.</hi> And let me add touching the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that when they preſented their firſt fruits at the Sanctuary, the offerer was to make an humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods mercy to him, and to the whole Nation, in a <hi>ſet Form</hi> of words; <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſpeak and ſay</hi> (theſe words) <hi>a Syrian ready to periſh was my Father,</hi> and ſo on to the Tenth <hi>Verſe</hi> incluſively. And at the end of their Tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every man of them was to ſay (theſe words) before the Lord, <hi>I have brought away the hollowed things out of mine houſe,</hi> and ſo on from the 13. to the 15. <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame Chapter. And to all this they were to add a <hi>ſet</hi> and a <hi>formal Prayer, look down, (O Lord) from thy holy Habitation, from Heaven, and bleſs thy people</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Land which thou haſt given us, as thou ſwareſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Fathers, verſ.</hi> 15. And then, laſtly, as concerning the <hi>Sons of Aaron, the Prieſts,</hi> their Office was in Gods name to bleſs the Congregation, after the daily Service was finiſht: and their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was to go up together upon an eminent place for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and there all of them lifting up their hands (and the People bowing their heads) one of the Prieſts was to pronounce the Bleſſing; and he was tyed to a <hi>certain Form</hi> (which is ſtill <note place="margin">Viſitation of the ſick.</note> retained in our Liturgy;) <hi>On this wiſe, ye ſhall bleſs the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying, the Lord bleſs thee, and keep thee; the Lord make his face to ſhine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</hi> From all theſe inſtances it doth plainly appear, that the whole pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service of God, in all its Parts, whether they did concern the <hi>People,</hi> or the <hi>Levites,</hi> or the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> was of Old tranſacted by them according to <hi>ſet</hi> and <hi>ſolemn Forms,</hi> at the <hi>Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well known, that beſides the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which was the only place of <hi>Sacrifices)</hi> the Jews had (eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the long Captivity) many <hi>Synagogues</hi> up and down in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at home and abroad, where they were diſperſed: and we are told that in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf there were no leſs, than an hundred and eighty Synagogues. The exact time is not known, when they were firſt Erected; but that the <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>ſtanding</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:41051:31"/>
Service of God was miniſtred in thoſe Synagogues, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Queſtion; and ſome are of opinion, that this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Service was <hi>anſwerable</hi> to that which was (but with more ſolemnity) celebrated at the <hi>Temple.</hi> However, that this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <note place="margin">

            <p>I cannot imagine what more is needful to ſhew, that the publick Service of God, among the Jews was ordered into <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſet Forms,</hi> both at the Temple, and in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues; that is, that they had their Liturgy and Common-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Book, as the Chriſtian Church had in after Ages, and as the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath ſtill. Only I ſhall add <hi>Ex abundanti,</hi> that even their more <hi>private Devotions</hi> were <hi>Preſcript</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> alſo. And I inſtance in the ſolemnity of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> which was kept in their Private houſes; they had <hi>ſet Forms of words,</hi> whereby they declared the meaning of the Myſtery, and of the inſtitution of the Lamb, the bitter Herbs, and the unleavened Bread; and this Declaration was called, a <hi>ſhewing forth</hi> of the Paſſover; to which the Apoſtle alludeth, when he ſaith of the Lords Supper, that it is a <hi>ſhewing forth of the Lords death,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26. They had ſet Forms of words for the <hi>Conſecration</hi> of the Bread and the Wine: over the Bread they ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed le thou, O Lord our God, the King of the World, which bringeſt forth Bread out of the Earth;</hi> and over the Cup they ſaid like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Bleſſed be thou, O Lord our God, the King of the World, which Createſt the fruit of the Vine.</hi> Laſtly; the whole action was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with ſinging of Pſalms, beginning at the hundred and thirteenth, and ſo on to the end of the hundred and eighteenth; which ſix Pſalms were called by them, the <hi>great</hi> Hallelujahs.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41051:32"/>
And I queſtion not, but as our Saviour uſed the uſual or the like Form, when he bleſſed the Bread and Wine; ſo alſo that they uſed that <hi>great Hallelujah,</hi> when the Evangeliſt tells us, <hi>that He and his Diſciples ſang an Hymn, and went out into the Mount of Olives,</hi> Matth. 26. 30.</p>

keep Chriſtians from being poiſoned with Erroneous and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Principles, as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy is at this day an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent amulet againſt infection from <hi>Papiſts, So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cinians, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> and other modern ſeducers: and perhaps this is the grand reaſon, why, the Bell-weathers of Faction hate our Common-Prayer Book, becauſe it ſtinteth their extravagant Spirits, who can ſow Hereſie and Sedition by their Praying, as well Preachments<hi>:</hi> this I am certain of, that many groſs errors which now prevail (eſpecially in the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> have been greatly occaſioned by the baſe Arts of men, who have time after time <hi>altered</hi> and <hi>corrupted</hi> the Ancient <hi>Service-Books,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inſenſibly inſinuating into mens breaſts ſuch things as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to Chriſtianity. But I will not digreſs further. To return to our purpoſe; it cannot be denyed, ſecondly, that in the dayes of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 380 years after our Lords birth, <hi>Liturgies</hi> were gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally uſed in the Churches of Chriſt, for at this hour there are <hi>Liturgies</hi> extant under the Names of thoſe Great men; and though we do not think, that theſe are the very <hi>ſame,</hi> which they uſed, becauſe latter ages have <hi>defaced</hi> them and <hi>foiſted</hi> many Heterogeneous things into them, yet 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to imagine, that St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> did not compile <hi>any,</hi> or that <hi>nothing</hi> of <hi>theſe</hi> was of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing. And yet what they did in this buſineſs was not a <hi>New</hi> thing; they were not the <hi>firſt diviſers</hi> of theſe Forms: no, they framed their <hi>Liturgies</hi> out of <hi>old Materials,</hi> and did <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>ſuit</hi> them to their <hi>own</hi> times. For it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, thirdly, that <hi>Liturgies</hi> were uſed, before ever theſe men were <hi>born.</hi> For the Ancients did conceive, that St. <hi>James</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and S. <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangeliſt, did <hi>both</hi> of them frame Liturgies for the uſe of their reſpective Churches, and though I dare not ſay, that this conceit is undoubtedly true; (much leſs, that the Liturgies, which are <hi>now</hi> called by their Names, and <hi>as</hi> we have them, were compoſed by them;) yet this I will affirm, that in the <hi>early</hi> days of Chriſtianity <hi>ſet Forms</hi> of Divine Service were uſed in the Churches of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria.</hi> Nay, if we conſider well of that Form of Service in the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> (which queſtionleſs is a moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41051:33"/>
one) and then compare thoſe Liturgies we find in the <hi>Bibliothcca Patrum</hi> called, S. <hi>Peters</hi> for <hi>Rome;</hi> S. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s for the <hi>Indians,</hi> S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s for the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> and the <hi>Moſarabe</hi> for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though we confeſs, that <hi>theſe</hi> as well as <hi>others</hi> have ſuffered many alterations, yet in all of them we may ſee ſuch plain <hi>foot-ſteps</hi> of <hi>prime</hi> Antiquity, that we may rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Liturgies were uſed in the very <hi>next ages</hi> to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, over all parts of Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>I know, this will be looked upon as a very high and bold aſſertion; and therefore I am bound to be the more punctual in this matter; and for proof thereof I ſhall appeal to ſuch Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies as are <hi>Authentick,</hi> and which being <hi>compared</hi> with the Liturgies before-mentioned, will ſatisfie any indifferent man, that ſuch and ſuch Forms were uſed by Chriſtians in the <hi>firſt Ages;</hi> and ſo, that in all <hi>probability</hi> they were <hi>directed</hi> by the Apoſtles, or <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Perſons. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>ſolemn</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; which cannot otherwiſe be underſtood, then of <hi>cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Forms</hi> of Prayer; eſpecially conſidering that he elſewhere <note place="margin">Solemnibus adimpletis Cypr. de lapſis.

Why, no doubt, thoſe charitable <hi>Forms</hi> which they uſed in the ordinary courſe of their <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>evening-</hi>ſervice. For ſuch we find in all the old Liturgies; and particularly, in that aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to S. <hi>Mark</hi> (which <hi>Cyprian</hi> perhaps might refer to) there is a <hi>Collect,</hi> after the Reading of the Goſpel, where the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſaith, <hi>Be pleaſed, O Lord, to ſend wholeſome ſhowres upon every thirſty Land; of thy Mercy give us fountains of waters; increaſe and bleſs the fruits of the earth; preſerve the Kingdom of thy Servant, whom thou haſt thought fit to ſet over us, in peace,</hi>

Again; whereas <hi>Celſus</hi> the Pagan ſlandered the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as men given to Magical Arts and Sorceries, <hi>Origen</hi> (who was but one remove from the times of the <hi>Apoſtles)</hi> affirmes poſitively and upon certain experience, that <hi>they who worſhip</hi>

And the difficulty may be eaſily aſſoiled, if we call to mind, that in the Primitive times it was a general cuſtome for the Deacon that read the ſervice to <hi>direct the people</hi> in their devotion, to tell them what they ſhould pray for, and to ſtir them up to beg ſuch and ſuch things of God, calling upon them after this manner, <hi>Let us pray, let us pray earneſtly,</hi>

            <p>3. This thing then being cleared, that there were <hi>preſcript Forms</hi> of Divine Service in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and even in that Age, which was the very <hi>next</hi> to the Apoſtles, I proceed to ſhew the <hi>third</hi> thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the Holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time, and in that <hi>interval</hi> between the <hi>burial</hi> of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and the <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of the Chriſtian <hi>Church, ſet Forms</hi> of Divine Service were allowed alſo. For confirmation whereof I think no Conſiderate man will deny, that the Apoſtles and their Diſciples <hi>conformed</hi> to the innocent Rites and Cuſtomes among the Jews, and <hi>joyned</hi> with them in the <hi>ordinary moral ſervice of God,</hi> which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <note place="margin">

That was the place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they conſtantly reſorted to Morning and Evening ſervice. For that being <hi>Moral,</hi> it was utterly <hi>repugnant</hi> to the deſigne of Chriſtianity to have <hi>deſtroyed</hi> it. Some <hi>other</hi> offices indeed (ſuch as the Celebration of the Lords Supper) as being <hi>prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to their Profeſſion, were to the <hi>Super-added</hi> to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſervice<hi>:</hi> and for that purpoſe their cuſtome was to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ</hi> from the <hi>Temple</hi> to the <hi>Caenaculum Sion,</hi> or that <hi>upper room,</hi> mentioned, Act. 1. 13.

And from the whole Hiſtory of the Apoſtles Acts it appears, that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and others were wont ever to reſort to the <hi>Synagogues</hi> at the <hi>uſual</hi> days and hours<hi>:</hi> and as it is improbable, that they would have been ſo <hi>punctual</hi> as to the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> of publick ſervice, had they not <hi>Conformed</hi> to the ſervice <hi>it ſelf;</hi> ſo it is incredible, that they ſhould have found ſuch <hi>eaſie</hi> acceſs, had not the Elders of the <hi>Jews</hi> lookt upon them as men of the <hi>ſame piece</hi> with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaving only in thoſe points touching the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s coming and the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of ſuch Ceremonies as were <hi>Typical,</hi> or ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of better things. 2. Again, it is clear that the Apoſtles were <hi>very careful,</hi> as far as it was conſiſtent with their duty, to give no offence unto the unbeleiving <hi>Jews,</hi> but by all poſſible ways of compliance to gain them over unto Chriſtianity: in ſomuch that St. <hi>Paul</hi> (who was one of the moſt ſtickling Apoſtles) profeſt before <hi>Feſtus</hi> Act. 25. 8. <hi>that neither againſt the law of the Jews, nor againſt the Temple, had he offended any thing at all.</hi> He declared before <hi>Foelix,</hi> Act. 24. 12, <hi>that they never found him in the Temple diſputing with any Man, neither raiſing up the people, neither in the Synagogues, nor in the City.</hi> And he told the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> Act. 28. 17. <hi>that he had committed nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi>

               <hi>as far</hi> as the Laws of Chriſtianity would give <hi>leave,</hi> that they might not exaſperate any. Now is it imaginable, that men who were ſo willing to <hi>abate</hi> of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and to comply with the <hi>Jews</hi> even in things that were <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Tranſitory,</hi> ſhould <hi>hold off in</hi> things that were their <hi>Duty,</hi> and <hi>oppoſe</hi> that ſervice of God which was <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> and <hi>permanent, I</hi> mean the received Prayers, Praiſes and Thankſgivings? 3. But that which fully clears this matter is, that even the <hi>converted Jews</hi> were extreamly ſhy of letting go any of their <hi>Rituals,</hi> though they had been <hi>better</hi> informed of the <hi>Deſigne</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of Chriſtianity, then <hi>others</hi> were, we find Act. 21. 20, 21. that <hi>there were many Myriads of Jews which believed, and they were all zealous of the Law:</hi> and when they had but an incling, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught the Proſelites abroad to forſake Moſes and not to walk after the Rites and cuſtomes of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> they were ſo moved <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Bezam. <hi>in loc.</hi>
               </note> at it, that the Bretheren at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were fain to adviſe him to <hi>purifie himſelf,</hi> and to ſatisfie them that he <hi>walked orderly.</hi> And ſince they did ſo pertinaciouſly inſiſt upon <hi>Punctilio's,</hi> can we conceive, that they would not inſiſt <hi>rather</hi> upon <hi>weighty</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? would they ſuffer the <hi>whole frame of</hi> their Religion to be altered, when they would not endure <hi>any part of it</hi> to be changed, or omitted? Certainly, had the Apoſtles gone about to take away their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and their <hi>Service-book</hi> too, and to deſtroy their <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Moral obſervances both,</hi> it would have been concluded, that their deſign was to make havock <hi>of all</hi> Religion, and to turn the World <hi>upſide down;</hi> and ſuch a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would have been made hereby, that Men would have crowded <hi>out of</hi> the Church with greater zeal, than ever they went <hi>into</hi> it. And therefore it is unqueſtionably clear, that the Apoſtles and their Diſciples did at their <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>common Aſſemblies</hi> carefully keep to that way of worſhip, which was then eſtabliſht, which (as hath been proved) was <hi>Preſcript,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The great Queſtion is, what their way of worſhip was in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41051:39"/>
their <hi>peculiar,</hi> and more <hi>private</hi> Aſſemblies, when they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to perform ſuch <hi>proper</hi> Exerciſes of Chriſtianity, as they were not <hi>permitted</hi> to perform either in the <hi>Temple,</hi> or at the <hi>Synagogue?</hi> That theſe Services were tranſacted <hi>without</hi> preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and Form, is ſtrongly believed and confidently aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome. And it muſt be acknowledged, that their <hi>occaſional</hi> Prayers were uttered after that manner, ſuch as that Prayer mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. And ſhould it be granted, that their <hi>whole</hi> Devotion was of <hi>ſudden</hi> conception <hi>then,</hi> it would be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the uſe of <hi>Set</hi> Forms <hi>now,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtles were <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> inſpired; whereas thoſe miraculous afflations of the Holy Ghoſt are <hi>ceaſed</hi> long ago; and the Queſtion is, not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unpremeditated Prayers are ſimply <hi>unlawful,</hi> but whether they are ſo <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> for the publick, ſince our wants and weakneſſes are ſo great, and the beſt of us can pretend but to the <hi>ordinary</hi> aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit upon our humane <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt confeſs, that I am not at all ſatisfied of the Truth of <hi>that conceit,</hi> that in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies in the Apoſtles dayes, there were <hi>no</hi> manner of <hi>Forms;</hi> or that their <hi>ordinary</hi> or <hi>ſtanding</hi> Services were performed wholly by <hi>extemporane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> ſuggeſtion. Indeed the Scripture gives us but little account <hi>of</hi> this matter: and therefore what is determin'd about it, muſt be concluded by the help of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and ſome <hi>Collateral</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. To the point then. The ſervice of God conſiſteth of <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Prayers.</hi> Now that the Chriſtians in the Apoſtles time had <hi>compoſed</hi> and <hi>ſet</hi> Forms of <hi>praiſing</hi> and <hi>glorifying</hi> God, ſeemeth highly probable from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that when they came together, <hi>every one of them had a Pſalm.</hi> This is a general word, comprehending both <hi>Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs,</hi> to the uſe whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians twice elſewhere; once in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 19. and again, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. Now 'tis hard to believe, that theſe ſeveral wayes of extolling Gods name, were conceived in the Church on a ſudden by the whole Congregation. Rather it is credible, that they came <hi>ready furniſhed</hi> with ſuitable Forms; either with thoſe which had been formerly compos'd by <hi>David,</hi> or with ſome that had been <hi>lately</hi> framed by Men <hi>inſpired;</hi> or with <hi>both</hi> (which is moſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41051:40"/>
likely.) For the ſame Spirit which moved the Prophets of old, did breath upon the Church now; and 'tis probable, that as <hi>David</hi> and others did by the dictates of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>compoſe Forms</hi> of praiſing God for the uſe of the whole Congregation; ſo in the Apoſtles time many were moved by the <hi>ſame</hi> Spirit to compoſe the like <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Hymns, for the uſe of the whole Church. So St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> tells us poſitively, <hi>that in thoſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>times they did frame</hi> Pſalms <hi>by the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.,</hi> And ſince the Apoſtle doth diſtinguiſh between <hi>theſe Pſalms</hi> and <hi>thoſe Revelations,</hi> which were given in an <hi>inſtant</hi> at the Church, it ſeemeth to be clear, that ſuch <hi>Formes</hi> were conceived <hi>at home,</hi> by ſuch as had the Gift of Tongues, and then (being <hi>rendered</hi> into a Language which they <hi>underſtood)</hi> were <hi>communicated</hi> to the People to be uſed by them at their ſolemn Meetings; and ſo they <hi>had</hi> (or, <hi>came provided of)</hi> Pſalms, when they came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For the ſcope of the Apoſtle there is to ſhew, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing ſhould be done in the Church, that <hi>others</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>benefit</hi> by it. And whereas ſome had the gift of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſtrange Languages, and were apt to boaſt of their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that Chapter proveth, that the Service of God ſhould be performed in a <hi>known</hi> Tongue, that every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an might <hi>bear a part</hi> in it; and ſo he concludeth, that <hi>even</hi> the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which were compoſed by Perſons inſpired, ſhould be <hi>firſt</hi> made <hi>intelligible,</hi> before they were uſed in their publick Aſſemblies, becauſe all things were to be done to ediſying.

            <p n="1">1.

There is no doubt, but he meaneth ſeveral <hi>diſtinct</hi> offices, unleſs we be ſo impudent as to affirm, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> heaped up <hi>many words,</hi> to <hi>no purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41051:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the <hi>prayer,</hi> for the <hi>whole Church before the Communion,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>mention</hi> is made of <hi>this command</hi> of the Apoſtles; as if <hi>(in her judgement)</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> required ſuch Prayers to be uſed at <hi>that</hi> time <hi>chiefly.</hi> In a word; the manifeſt <hi>agreement</hi> of all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies in <hi>this particular,</hi> and the <hi>conſtant, uniform,</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> practiſe of all Chriſtians from the beginning all along, uſing certain <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Supplication, Prayer, Interceſſion,</hi> and <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> for all men, and for Kings <hi>eſpecially,</hi> (and that too in the <hi>Communion-office)</hi> is a loud and clear argument to me, that they <hi>conceived</hi> this their <hi>practice</hi> to have been according to the Apoſtles <hi>order,</hi> and thoſe their <hi>Forms</hi> to have been according to the Apoſtles mind. And hence I conclude, that either the <hi>whole</hi> Catholick Church hath not yet <hi>underſtood St. Pauls</hi> ſenſe, but has been clearly <hi>miſtaken</hi> in his meaning (which I hope will never be granted;) or elſe, that <hi>that</hi> carries much truth in it, which <hi>Durantus</hi> Cites out of <hi>Haymo,</hi> viz. that the <hi>Bleſſed Apoſtle</hi>

            <p>But to ſpeak freely, it ſeems very <hi>probable,</hi> that the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did, in their <hi>ordinary</hi> Miniſtrations, obſerve <hi>Forms</hi> of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>themſelves,</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe <hi>extroardinary</hi> aſſiſtances of the Spirit, which they were bleſt with.

In the mean time, if there be any truth in <hi>S. Chryſoſtomes</hi> account of this matter, we muſt couclude, that the

men, who were thus enabled to Pray, did teach others, either by <hi>propounding prayers</hi> to them, that they might give their conſent to them, ſaying, <hi>Lord have mercy,</hi> or ſome ſuch Form<hi>:</hi> or by <hi>uſing</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi> prayers <hi>frequently,</hi> ſo that by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>repetition</hi> of them they might the better be <hi>fixed</hi> in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>memories;</hi> or by <hi>committing thoſe</hi> Prayers which they had conceived, to <hi>writing,</hi> that they might be of <hi>conſtant uſe</hi> unto the whole Church, in their <hi>ordinary</hi> ſervices.

It is <hi>unlikely,</hi> that they, who did <hi>inſiſt</hi> ſo much upon <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>decency,</hi> would not be careful rather of that which is moſt <hi>material.</hi> It is <hi>unlikely,</hi> that they, who would not <hi>indure</hi> any <hi>Confuſion,</hi> any <hi>Irreverence,</hi> any <hi>

The Learned and Judicious Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> was clearly of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">View of the New Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> that ſuch as had the <hi>Gift of prayer</hi> in the Apoſtles days, did <hi>firſt conceive,</hi> and then did <hi>frequently uſe</hi> ſome <hi>ſpecial</hi> Forms of Prayer for daily and conſtant wants; and that theſe Forms were <hi>received</hi> and <hi>kept</hi> by Apoſtolical men, who had ſo benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under them.

               <hi>perfected,</hi> by the pious diligence of holy and good men, who made what <hi>Collections</hi> they could of <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> Apoſtles pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and <hi>added</hi> others, where it was needful. For it was ſome conſiderable <hi>time,</hi> before theſe Liturgies were <hi>perfectly</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated; becauſe ſome Doctors of the Church were ever and anon deſirous of preſcribing <hi>new</hi> Forms of their <hi>own,</hi> and of adding them to the <hi>old</hi> ſtock. And this was a thing ſo <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual</hi> in thoſe early times, that ſome <hi>Councels</hi> were fain to <note place="margin">

               <hi>interpoſe,</hi> and <hi>reſtrain</hi> men from adding Prayers of their own, at their pleaſure. The <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this, was founded on the Practice of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> perſons (their Co-temporaries and Followers:) 'twas in <hi>imitation</hi> and by <hi>example</hi> of them, that Biſhops in <hi>ſucceeding</hi> Ages did <hi>preſcribe</hi> certain <hi>ſpecial</hi> prayers of their compoſing; becauſe they had obſerved, that many Forms had been conceived heretofore by <hi>S. James</hi> for the uſe of the Churches of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and that the like had been done, not onely by other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> for the uſe of other Churches, but alſo by the Apoſtles immediate <hi>ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> who had <hi>collected</hi> many Prayers <hi>compoſed</hi> by their <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,</hi> and added more of their <hi>own</hi> Conception: which gave <hi>encouragemant</hi> to others to do ſo <hi>too,</hi> till Liturgies did <hi>ſwell</hi> ſo, that <hi>S. Baſil</hi> and <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> thought it convenient to <hi>abridge</hi> them. All this <hi>framing, compoſing,</hi> and <hi>preſcribing</hi> of <hi>Forms</hi> of Prayer, was originally <hi>occaſioned</hi> by Apoſtolical practice. And for what the Holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did in this matter, there are ſuch <hi>precedents,</hi> as are beyond all manner of exception. For ſo did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>other inſpired</hi> perſons of old, <hi>conceive, preſcribe,</hi> and <hi>deliver Forms</hi> of Service unto the Church under the <hi>Law.</hi> So did <hi>S. John</hi> the Baptiſt in <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, <hi>teach</hi> his Diſciples to pray, by giving them a <hi>Form.</hi> Nay, ſo did Chriſt <hi>himſelf</hi> teach the very <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to pray, by delivering to them a moſt perfect <hi>Form</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> conception. And then, that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves</hi> (who were acted by the <hi>ſame</hi> Spirit) ſhould likewiſe <hi>conceive,</hi> and <hi>give</hi> unto <hi>Chriſtians Forms</hi> alſo, I think no wiſe man will wonder; and that they uſed not the <hi>Lords prayer themſelves</hi> in all their Services, I think none but a mad man will have the confidence to aſſert.</p>
            <p>All which things being duely conſidered, I will take upon
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41051:43"/>
me to affirm, that as <hi>Set</hi> Forms of Divine Service were uſed by the <hi>Jews before</hi> and <hi>in</hi> the life-time of our Saviour, and by all <hi>Chriſtians after</hi> the Age of the Apoſtles; ſo in that <hi>intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate juncture</hi> of time, between the <hi>Aſcention</hi> of our Saviour, and the <hi>ſetling</hi> of Chriſtianity, <hi>ſet</hi> Forms of divine ſervice were for certain <hi>allowed,</hi> and in all probability <hi>practiſed, uſed,</hi> and <hi>tranſmitted</hi> unto the Church, by the <hi>Apoſtles, themſelves,</hi> and their <hi>Fellow-labourers, whoſe names were written in the Book of life.</hi> And ſo the firſt thing is diſpatched, which I undertook to make out, touching the <hi>Ancient</hi> uſe of <hi>Set</hi> Forms of Divine Service in <hi>General.</hi> Thus far, to be ſure, we tread in the <hi>old ways,</hi> in that we worſhip the God of our Father, as our <hi>old</hi> Fathers did, by a <hi>ſet</hi> and <hi>preſcript</hi> Form.</p>
            <p>2. Next I proceed to ſpeak of <hi>this form</hi> in <hi>particular;</hi> I mean <hi>our Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> about which there have been longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, then were once between the <hi>Angel</hi> and the <hi>Divel, diſputing about the Body of Moſes.</hi> I ſhall not inſiſt either upon <note place="margin">

            <p>Our Service concludes, as it did of old both in the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, with ſeveral Prayers.

And of this <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>ſtrain</hi> are thoſe <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>occaſional</hi> prayers, with which our daily Service is wont to <hi>end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great exceptions have been taken, by ſome, at our <hi>Litany:</hi> and yet it is as <hi>charitable,</hi> and as <hi>Chriſtian</hi> a piece of Devotion, <note place="margin">The Litany.</note> as ever could be framed by <hi>humane</hi> Pen, if people will but bring with them <hi>hearts</hi> that are as <hi>good,</hi> as the <hi>matter</hi> before them is <hi>excellent:</hi> Here is <hi>Fire and Wood enough,</hi> if the <hi>Lamb</hi> be not <hi>wanting</hi> for the Sacrifice. Our <hi>Litany</hi> conſiſteth of <hi>two</hi> main parts. The one is offered up by the <hi>Miniſter</hi> going <hi>before</hi> in <hi>ſupplications, prayers,</hi> and <hi>interceſſions</hi> (exactly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.) The other part is offered up by the <hi>people</hi> following <hi>after</hi> in their joynt <hi>ſuffrages</hi> and with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41051:46"/>
ſuch <hi>earneſt</hi> and <hi>importunate</hi> cryes, as pierce the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Now, this <hi>way</hi> of expreſſing our Devotions, by <hi>turns</hi> (the Miniſter in <hi>his</hi> turn, and the Congregation in <hi>theirs)</hi> is not only an admirable way to <hi>kindle</hi> and <hi>enflame</hi> each others zeal; but moreover, 'tis a way and method <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the way and method of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> and uſed many hundreds of years (or, Ages) before the date of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Miniſters</hi> going <hi>before</hi> the people, both by his <hi>example,</hi> and by <hi>calling</hi> upon them to joyn with him. We find, it was the continual practice of <hi>David,</hi> not onely to make Addreſſes <hi>himſelf</hi> unto God; but alſo to <hi>invite,</hi> and <hi>call upon</hi> others to do ſo likewiſe. <hi>O come, let us ſing unto the Lord; let us magnifie his name together; praiſe the Lord, ye houſe of</hi> Iſrael<hi>: praiſe the Lord, ye houſe of</hi> Aaron<hi>: praiſe the Lord, ye houſe of</hi> Levi<hi>: ye that fear the Lord, praiſe the Lord:</hi> and in Pſal. 107. <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord; O that men would praiſe the Lord; which form</hi> is repeated again no leſs than <hi>three</hi> times in the <hi>ſame</hi> Pſalm, as an <hi>admonition</hi> to <hi>keep up</hi> the Devotion of People. And are not thoſe Ancient <hi>Litany-forms</hi> uſed by the <hi>Deacons, (Let us pray, let us beſeech the Lord, let us pray earneſtly,</hi> are they not) exactly <hi>anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> to theſe <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Allocution</hi> uſed by this inſpired and holy man? If the Spirit thought fit to have ſuch Forms uſed in <hi>praiſing</hi> God; it is not unſuitable to the uſual ſtrain of that Spirit, to uſe the <hi>like</hi> Forms in <hi>praying</hi> unto God too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As touching the peoples <hi>following</hi> the Miniſter by their <hi>ſuffrages,</hi> it is a method no more unbecoming Gods Spirit, then the other; and nothing has been more cuſtomary, than for the people to have their <hi>turns,</hi> and to <hi>bear a part</hi> in Gods Worſhip. After that remarkable victory over <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> and his forces, the whole body of the Jews ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhore of the Red Sea, to bleſs God for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: and we find, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. that <hi>Moſes</hi> the Prophet and the <hi>men</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> divided themſelves into <hi>one</hi> body, and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi> the Propheteſs with the <hi>women</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into <hi>another</hi> body; and as <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>men</hi> Sang his Triumphant Hymn, ſo <hi>Miriam</hi> and the <hi>women</hi> anſwered them, ſaying, <hi>Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſly; the</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:41051:47"/>
               <hi>Horſe and his Rider hath he thrown into the Sea.</hi> This Form of Praiſe they <hi>repeated</hi> (in all probability) <hi>after</hi> every verſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> Song<hi>:</hi> for we read of <hi>nothing</hi> elſe that they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, but only, <hi>Sing ye to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And if <hi>they</hi> had a Form of <hi>praiſe,</hi> which they <hi>repeated</hi> after every <hi>verſe</hi> as the <hi>ground,</hi> and <hi>foot,</hi> and <hi>burden</hi> of the <hi>Hymn;</hi> is it unſuitable, if <hi>we</hi> have a Form of <hi>prayer</hi> for the people to <hi>repeat</hi> after eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Petition,</hi> as the <hi>ground, foot,</hi> and <hi>burden</hi> of the <hi>Litany?</hi> If they were directed by the Spirit of God, when <hi>Moſes</hi> went <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them</hi> in a Song, to anſwer, <hi>Sing ye unto the Lord,</hi> (when they were delivered) then it is alſo agreeable to the ſtyle of the ſame Spirit, when the Miniſter goeth before <hi>us</hi> in our <hi>prayer,</hi> for us to anſwer, <hi>Good Lord deliver us.</hi> Further, it is to be conſidered, that the <hi>136th. Pſalm</hi> ſeemeth to have been compoſed by the Prophet on purpoſe, that the <hi>end</hi> of each Verſe might be <hi>repeated</hi> throughout by the whole Congregation; <hi>O Give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious; and his mercy endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever, for his mercy endureth for ever, for his mercy endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever:</hi> this is the <hi>burden</hi> of the Pſalm from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the cloſe of it. And we may eaſily collect from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 13. that at the Dedication of <hi>Solomons Temple</hi> this Pſalm was <hi>repeated</hi> thus by <hi>turns,</hi> one of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſaying <hi>before,</hi> the former part of each Verſe, and then all the <hi>Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> following after with one voice, and ſaying <hi>(all along)</hi> for <hi>he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> And ſince they were directed by Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>ſubjoyn</hi> throughout their <hi>prayers, for his mercy, for his mercy, for his mercy endureth for ever;</hi> it cannot be thought <hi>unbecoming</hi> Gods Spirit, if <hi>we</hi> are directed to ſubjoyn in our <hi>Prayers, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> And ſo, I hope, the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Contexture</hi> of our Litany, will ſeem to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different perſon, to be free from all charge of <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is free alſo from all juſt charge of <hi>

Miſſal. But 'tis clear to every knowing man, that it was a very <hi>Ancient</hi> and a very <hi>uſual</hi> way among Chriſtians, to pray <hi>Litany-wiſe.</hi> It was ſo <hi>Ancient</hi> a way, that for ought any man knows to the contrary, it was uſed in the moſt <hi>early</hi> times of Chriſtianity. For in the <hi>oldeſt</hi> Rituals which are in being, there are <hi>many</hi> ſuch Forms of Prayer; and ſome <hi>Ancient</hi> Service-books do conſiſt of ſuch for the <hi>moſt</hi> part. 'Tis true indeed, they were not <hi>called</hi> Litanies at the <hi>firſt,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

And then they were called <hi>Litanies,</hi> and <hi>Rogations.</hi> Hence it is, that <hi>Mamertus</hi> and others are ſaid to have fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Litanies,</hi> becauſe they <hi>enlarged</hi> them, and uſed them in manner aforeſaid. And hence it is, that S. <hi>Baſil</hi> told the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> of <hi>Neocaeſaria,</hi> that there were no <hi>Litanies</hi> in <hi>Gregory's</hi> days; becauſe that <hi>name,</hi> and that <hi>uſe</hi> of them was not <hi>then</hi> known. But yet it is <hi>as</hi> true, that ſuch <hi>Forms</hi> of ſupplication and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Prayer were very <hi>anciently</hi> in uſe, and <hi>before</hi> the times either of <hi>Baſil</hi> or <hi>Gregory:</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his Homily upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. deriveth the <hi>Original</hi> of them from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times.

I have inſtanced in ſeveral particulars; and a longer account might be given, if that would do our buſineſs effectually: But I hope what hath been already ſhewed, will ſatisfie all <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>ſober</hi> perſons, that our Church is free from all charge of <hi>Superſtition and Novelty.</hi> I would to God ſhe were as free from <hi>danger</hi> too; danger which is now threatned her, <hi>not only</hi> by thoſe who <hi>never were</hi> in her <hi>boſom,</hi> but by thoſe <hi>alſo</hi> to whom ſhe, like an indulgent <hi>Mother,</hi> hath held out <hi>both</hi> her <hi>Breaſts,</hi> and hath received nothing for all her <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs,</hi> but a <hi>Stab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet it is not too late to <hi>heal</hi> her wounds, if men would ſet <hi>heartily</hi> and <hi>ſoberly</hi> about it. But in my opinion, there is no Method likely to do it, but by taking Directions from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and by obſerving the <hi>Old way,</hi> that <hi>old</hi> and <hi>good</hi> way wherein, God be bleſſed, Religion has hitherto flouriſhed among us, and for which our Church is at this day the <hi>Envy</hi> of all <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> and the <hi>Glory</hi> of the whole <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world.</p>
            <p>For (that I may now <hi>cloſe</hi> up my Argument) ſhould we deviate and wander from the <hi>Primitive</hi> Rule, our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> will have an <hi>unanſwerable</hi> Plea againſt us, That our Religion is <hi>not Catholick,</hi> but a <hi>Muſhrome</hi> of <hi>yesterday;</hi> and by that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41051:56"/>
pretence, they will never want fair <hi>opportunities</hi> of catching up Sheep that ſtraggle from a <hi>ſecure</hi> Fold, and making a Prey of <hi>all</hi> by <hi>degrees.</hi> By what we have found <hi>already</hi> by ſad <hi>experience,</hi> we may eaſily <hi>foreſee</hi> what advantages they will take <hi>hereafter,</hi> ſhould we <hi>alter</hi> our way. For how many thouſand Souls have they enſnared by <hi>this</hi> pretence, That our <hi>Religion is a new Device?</hi> 'Twould be a <hi>ſtrong</hi> Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, were not the thing <hi>falſe.</hi> Now, if they have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſo many by an <hi>unjust Allegation,</hi> what will the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences be, ſhould we do them the <hi>kindneſs</hi> to remove our <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> Land-marks; and make that an <hi>evident Truth,</hi> which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto has been nothing but a <hi>groundleſs Reproach?</hi> It may be thought a <hi>probable</hi> way to keep Popery <hi>out;</hi> but 'twill be a <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> way to let it <hi>in</hi> upon us at the laſt: For, what have we ever yet gotten by <hi>pulling down,</hi> but <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi> and what are our <hi>Factions,</hi> but the <hi>Kennels</hi> of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuited</hi> perſons? We ſee in part <hi>already,</hi> and when the <hi>mystery</hi> of <hi>Iniquity</hi> comes <hi>throughly</hi> to be laid open, we ſhall ſee more <hi>evidently</hi> and <hi>fully,</hi> that 'tis by the ſeveral <hi>Sects</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us that the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> gets into our <hi>Bowels,</hi> and hides, lurks, and ſhrouds himſelf <hi>under them:</hi> and men of common Reaſon will think, that 'tis but in vain to drive the Papiſt <hi>out</hi> at the <hi>fore gate,</hi> if he be let <hi>in</hi> again at the <hi>back-door.</hi> But ſhould our Church be <hi>diſmantled,</hi> and Iniquitie be <hi>establiſht by a Law,</hi> inſtead of <hi>one Jeſuit</hi> we ſhall have an <hi>hundred;</hi> and in the end the wilde <hi>Boar</hi> will finde admittance, after ſo many little <hi>Foxes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3.

            <p>And this I ſhall do out of a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> deſigne to do the world <hi>good,</hi> and to ſerve <hi>them</hi> eſpecially who are apt to go aſtray in the <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of their hearts, and have neither the <hi>wiſdom</hi> to make a <hi>ſtand</hi> before they go <hi>too</hi> far, nor the <hi>ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> to <hi>foreſee</hi> whither they are going, nor the <hi>skill</hi> to <hi>retrive</hi> themſelves, nor <hi>eyes</hi> to <hi>finde out</hi> the <hi>right</hi> way, nor perhaps any great <hi>deſire</hi> to <hi>revert</hi> into the paths they have once <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:41051:56"/>
but walk with the Herd, <hi>non quâ eundum est, ſed qua itur</hi> (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks) not where they <hi>ſhould</hi> go, but where the <hi>Multitude</hi> goeth, not conſidering that, <hi>Argumentum peſſimi Turba est,</hi> that courſe is many times the <hi>worst,</hi> which hath the <hi>most</hi> Voices, and is carried <hi>by the Poll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. that by traducing his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King, and his Miniſters of Juſtice, he <hi>ſtole away the hearts of the men of Iſrael, and many followed him, and went with him in their ſimplicity, not knowing</hi> any thing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion he intended, when he pretended to go to <hi>Hebron to pay his vows.</hi> And I am verily perſwaded, that this is the caſe of many <hi>deluded</hi> wretches amongſt <hi>us,</hi> who have been perſwaded to go <hi>from Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Hebron</hi> to worſhip, in the <hi>ſimplicity of their hearts,</hi> having been <hi>impoſed</hi> upon by the <hi>popular</hi> and <hi>ſlie</hi> inſinuations of ſome <hi>Abſaloms,</hi> who deſigned to <hi>abuſe</hi> their <hi>Credulity,</hi> and to uſe them as <hi>Inſtruments</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their unworthy <hi>Ends,</hi> and ſecular <hi>Advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſuch I would addreſs my ſelf, beſeeching them by the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by the bowels of <hi>Christ,</hi> and by the regard we ought to have of our <hi>common</hi> Salvation, to take an Inventory of thoſe ſore Evils, which have been ſo hurtful to <hi>Mankinde,</hi> ſo reproachful to <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſo prejudicial to our common <hi>Safety;</hi> and all of them occaſioned <hi>principally</hi> by this <hi>one radical</hi> Evil, even <hi>mens</hi> ſtragling and deviating from the good <hi>old way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, It hath been one main thing that hath <hi>ſtopt the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> of Religion, and diſcouraged very many from entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Truth, as it is in Jeſus.</hi> And though ſome may make <hi>light</hi> of this Conſideration <hi>now,</hi> yet in the Judgment of the <hi>Great day,</hi> when the <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Scandals</hi> of men ſhall be reckon'd unto them, it will be a <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>fearful</hi> Charge, that they have <hi>kept off</hi> ſo many Souls, for whom Chriſt died, from coming unto him. What multitudes and ſholes of Infidels crouded into the Church in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, when the <hi>Creed</hi> was <hi>entire,</hi> and the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God was <hi>uniform,</hi> and the Way to Heaven was <hi>one and the ſame</hi> over all the World!

               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41051:57"/>
ſince the Streams have been <hi>divided.</hi> Though Infidels of all Nations and Languages be diſperſed up and down throughout <hi>Christendom,</hi> yet how rarely do we hear of <hi>one hearty</hi> Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte?

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is, a fair Argument may be uſed to perſwade men that <hi>Truth</hi> is to be found <hi>there.</hi> But when the <hi>Turk,</hi> or the <hi>Jew,</hi> or the blinde <hi>Papist</hi> perceives us to be at variance about the <hi>main</hi> thing, ſome contending for <hi>one</hi> way, and ſome for <hi>another,</hi> and every Party <hi>condemning</hi> all ways but his <hi>own,</hi> he finds that 'tis great odds, but he may erre ſtill, which ſide <hi>ſoever</hi> he takes; and thinks it much ſafer to commit himſelf to his <hi>own</hi> conduct, or to the management of a Guide that pretends to be <hi>infallible,</hi> than to truſt the Directions of men <hi>divided</hi> in their Judgments, who inſtead of <hi>reſcuing,</hi> may chance to <hi>draw him on</hi> into further <hi>danger.</hi> When <hi>Averroës</hi> ſaw the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts to <hi>devour</hi> that which they ſuppoſed to be their <hi>God,</hi> he ventured his Soul with the <hi>old Philoſophers,</hi> rather than he would embrace ſuch a <hi>Savage</hi> Religion.

               <hi>other</hi> things are little too, and in the end <hi>deride</hi> and make light of <hi>All</hi> things, though of the <hi>greatest</hi> moment.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be glad to be miſtaken in this particular, and that any man were able to confute the truth of what I ſay. But the thing is manifeſt, that ſeveral who have been Members of <hi>many</hi> Sects, have in the end ript themſelves from <hi>All,</hi> and upon tryal made of <hi>every Profeſſion,</hi> have at laſt <hi>abandoned</hi> every <hi>Religion.</hi> And I wiſh that ſome who pretend to be the great <hi>Healers</hi> in <hi>Sion,</hi> would in time conſider what account they will be able to give to the Great <hi>Phyſician</hi> of our Souls, for <hi>intoxicating</hi> the world when they undertook <hi>new Ways</hi> and Methods of <hi>purging</hi> it. For <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>true</hi> original of this ſad Calamity, even mens love of <hi>Novelty,</hi> and of <hi>new Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> By making a falſe ſtep at the <hi>first,</hi> men have run themſelves and others upon Deſtruction; and there is no end of Error, when once they have forſaken the <hi>Old</hi> Paths, where alone is to be found <hi>true</hi> Reſt, and <hi>ſure</hi> Footing.</p>
            <p>3. To theſe Conſiderations I ſhall adde <hi>one more,</hi> which I have reſerved unto the laſt, becauſe it is of very <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> uſe, and may, perhaps, make a deeper impreſſion than the reſt; and it is this: That thoſe <hi>Innovations</hi> and <hi>Schiſms</hi> which have <hi>defaced,</hi> and almoſt <hi>ruined</hi> our Church, have been cunningly <hi>contriv'd</hi> (at leaſt, <hi>improv'd</hi> and <hi>kept on foot)</hi> by the <hi>Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hate nothing more than to ſee <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>

            <p>I have not made theſe Remarks, as if I did believe that all our <hi>former</hi> Non-conformiſts were <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> God forbid<hi>:</hi> but I fear that great <hi>numbers</hi> of them were <hi>Jeſuited,</hi> and they knew it not, at leaſt did not <hi>conſider</hi> it.

But ſhould our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries prevail, no Faction muſt think to fare the better for their <hi>pretended Demonſtrations,</hi> nor muſt any expect either to <hi>triumph,</hi> or to finde <hi>quarter,</hi> unleſs it be the <hi>Atheist;</hi> becauſe men who are <hi>imperious</hi> and <hi>bigotted,</hi> when once they come to be armed with <hi>Power,</hi> will more patiently endure to ſee men to have <hi>no Religion</hi> at all, than to ſee them have a <hi>different Religion</hi> from their own. What then will our peeviſh Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren get at laſt, but a <hi>certainty</hi> of being buried in the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Ruine? And if they are not of <hi>Sampſons</hi> temper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to die <hi>themſelves,</hi> rather than the <hi>Houſe</hi> they heave at ſhould not fall, it highly concerns them to conſider, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> can ſupport our Houſe <hi>long;</hi> and that which is deſired of them, is, that if they <hi>will not,</hi> or <hi>cannot</hi> put their <hi>own</hi> ſhoulders under to prop the <hi>Houſe</hi> up, they would at leaſt let the <hi>Pillars alone</hi> upon which it ſtandeth <hi>now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fond people!</hi> that like him that ſet fire on <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple to get himſelf a Name, rather than venture a little of their Reputation with the Populacy, will venture their <hi>own</hi> and the <hi>publick</hi> Safety: For to that it muſt come in the end, if ſome ſtop be not ſet in time to mens wandring from the <hi>Old</hi> Paths. Had we all ſtayed <hi>there,</hi> neither <hi>Deſtruction</hi> nor <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> could have been before us <hi>now.</hi> And the ſubtle <hi>Jeſuit</hi> perceiv'd it long ago: and therefore his great <hi>Expedient</hi> and <hi>Deſigne</hi> was to lead men <hi>aſide</hi> out of this way, to lead them by the Noſe into ſome <hi>by paths,</hi> and withal to lead them like <hi>Solomons fools, to the correction of the Stocks.</hi> Our <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are now his <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> but at laſt he doth intend to make them his <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and to make himſelf either their <hi>Lawgiver</hi> or their <hi>Priest.</hi> The little <hi>Jackall</hi> that runneth ſo hotly after the Prey, doth but ſerve the <hi>Lion,</hi> that upon the leaſt diſtaſte
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41051:70"/>
is ready to devour the <hi>Booty</hi> and <hi>him</hi> too. Such is the courſe of the world, that men fare very ill by ſerving wicked and outragious Maſters; they receive the <hi>worſt returns</hi> for the <hi>best ſervices,</hi> like the <hi>Elm,</hi> that is many times <hi>killed</hi> by the <hi>Ivy</hi> that twiſted it ſelf about its body, and could not have grown without its Support. I ſhall adde a known ſtory of <hi>Annibal,</hi> That his Army being environ'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces, to defeat them of their hopes of victory, he uſed this <hi>Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem:</hi> In the night he gathered two thouſand Oxen, faſtened <note place="margin">Plutarch <hi>in</hi> Fabio.</note> combuſtible matter about their horns, then ſet it all on fire, and ſo forced the Cattle upon the Enemies Camp, to put them into <hi>diſorder</hi> and a <hi>fright;</hi> and by this wile he drew off his <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The poor Beaſts went on quietly for a <hi>while,</hi> but at laſt the ſenſe of the fire made them <hi>mad;</hi> and the more they endeavoured to ſhake the <hi>flames off,</hi> the more they <hi>ſmarted.</hi> An inſtance which I would recommend to the ſerious conſideration of thoſe ſilly people who are unawares <hi>employ'd</hi> by the politick <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> to diſturb and defeat <hi>us,</hi> if it be poſſible. However they may go on, like <hi>Annibal</hi>'s Oxen, <hi>ſecurely</hi> for a while, with their <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>horns</hi> lifted up, and not perceive the miſchief that is <hi>over</hi> their <hi>own pates;</hi> yet before theſe <hi>Combuſtions</hi> are quite over, they are likely to be rewarded with nothing but <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> for their ſervice, and to ſmart ſufficiently by the <hi>fire</hi> in their <hi>heads.</hi> They may make way for <hi>Annibal,</hi> and be <hi>burnt</hi> themſelves, even by the <hi>hands</hi> that ſet them on work.</p>
            <p>All this may (by Gods Bleſſing) be prevented, if men would but be wiſe in <hi>time.</hi> But whatever <hi>Concluſions</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments</hi> ſome may think to try, no better directions can be given, than to ſtand and aſk for the <hi>Old Paths.</hi> There we muſt begin to mend, where the Sin and Danger doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence. All our <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and <hi>Diſorders,</hi> and <hi>Dangers,</hi> and whatſoever <hi>Calamities</hi> we have had either <hi>Time</hi> to <hi>feel,</hi> or juſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> to <hi>fear,</hi> all of them take their riſe from this <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> Evil, that men have been unreaſonable in declining from the <hi>Old way.</hi> Had our <hi>Government</hi> its due <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Authority, as in the days of old:</hi> Would the <hi>Hearts</hi> of

            <p>God of his Mercy <hi>Grant us Peace in our days; and give us Eyes to ſee, and Hearts ſeriouſly to conſider the things which do belong unto our Peace, before they are hid from our Eyes.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>I <hi>Shall by way of</hi> Appendix <hi>tranſcribe a paſſage out of that very</hi> learned <hi>and</hi> excellent <hi>man Dr.</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon, <hi>in his</hi> Preface <hi>to his Sermons, bearng date</hi> July 13, 1657. <hi>where,</hi> clearing <hi>the</hi> regular <hi>Sons of the Church of</hi> England <hi>from the unjuſt Aſperſions of being</hi> Popiſhly <hi>affected, he ſaith,</hi> 1. <hi>That thoſe very perſons, who were under God the Inſtruments of freeing us from the</hi> Roman <hi>yoke, by caſting Popery out of the Church, and ſundry of them</hi> Martyred <hi>in the Cauſe; thoſe very perſons, I ſay, were great</hi> Favourers <hi>of theſe (now accounted,</hi> Popiſh) Ceremonies, <hi>and the chief Authors or Procurers of the Conſtitutions made in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</hi> 2. <hi>That in all former Times ſince the beginning of the Reformation, our</hi> Arch-biſhops <hi>and</hi> Biſhops, <hi>with their Chaplains, and others of the</hi> Prelatical <hi>Party, were the</hi> principal <hi>(I had almoſt ſaid, the</hi> only) <hi>Champions to maintain the Cauſe of Religion againſt the</hi> Papiſts. 3. <hi>That even in theſe times of ſo great</hi> diſtraction, <hi>and conſequently thereunto, of ſo great</hi> advantage <hi>to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for</hi> Rome, <hi>none have ſtept into the gap more</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, <hi>nor appear'd in the face of the Enemy more openly, nor maintain'd the fight with more</hi> Stoutneſs <hi>and</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, <hi>than the</hi> Epiſcopal Divines <hi>have done, as their late learned Writings teſtifie. Yea, and ſome of them ſuch, as (beſides their</hi> other <hi>Sufferings) have lain as deep under the Suſpicion of being</hi> Popiſhly <hi>affected, as</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:41051:71"/>
               <hi>nay other of their Brethren whoſoever.</hi> 4. <hi>That by the endeavours of theſe</hi> Epiſcopal Divines, <hi>ſome that were bred</hi> Papiſts <hi>have been gained to our Church, others that began to</hi> waver confirmed <hi>and</hi> ſetled <hi>in their</hi> old <hi>Religion, and ſome that were fallen from Us recovered and</hi> reduced, <hi>notwithſtanding all the diſadvantages of theſe confuſed Times; and of each of theſe I am able to produce ſome Inſtance. But I profeſs ſincerely, as in the preſence of God, and before the world, that I have not known (at leaſt, I cannot call to remembrance) ſo much as</hi> one ſingle Example <hi>of any of this done by any of our</hi> Anti-ceremonian <hi>Brethren, whether</hi> Presbyterian <hi>or</hi> Independent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I have ſomewhat to</hi> return <hi>upon theſe our</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>who thus cauſeleſly ſuſpect us. Poſſibly it will not pleaſe them</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:] <hi>but I muſt ſpeak it out, both for the</hi> Truths <hi>ſake and</hi> theirs: <hi>to wit, That themſelves are in</hi> truth, <hi>though not</hi> purpoſely <hi>and</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally <hi>(whereof in my own thought I freely acquit them) yet</hi> really <hi>and</hi> eventually <hi>the great</hi> Promoters <hi>of the</hi> Roman Intereſt <hi>among us, and that more ways than one. Firſt, by putting to their helping hand to the pulling down of</hi> Epiſcopacy. <hi>It is very well known to many, what rejoycing that</hi> Vote <hi>brought to the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh <hi>Party: How even in</hi> Rome <hi>itſelf they ſang their</hi> Io Paeans <hi>upon the tidings thereof, and ſaid trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly,</hi> Now is the day ours; now is the fatal Blow given to the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>England. They, who by converſing much with</hi> that <hi>Nation, were well-acquainted with the fiery turbulent ſpirits of the</hi> Scotiſh
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41051:72"/>
Presbyterians, <hi>knew as well how to make their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereof: and handled the matter with ſo much cunning, by fomenting their Diſcontents underhand, till they had framed</hi> them, <hi>and by their means, ſome of the</hi> ſame Party <hi>here, to become the fitteſt Inſtruments for the carrying on of their great Deſigne: And this, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, was the very Maſter-piece of the whole Plot. They could not but foreſee (as the Event hath alſo proved) that if the</hi> Old Government, <hi>a</hi> main Pillar <hi>in the Building, were once diſſolved, the whole Fabrick would be ſore</hi> ſhaken, <hi>if not preſently</hi> ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <hi>in pieces and</hi> ruin'd: <hi>things would preſently run into</hi> Confuſion<hi>: Diſtractions and Diviſions would certainly follow; and when the Waters ſhould be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently</hi> troubled <hi>and</hi> mudded, <hi>then would be their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to caſt in their</hi> nets <hi>for a</hi> draught, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whoſo pleaſeth, may read on; and indeed the whole <hi>Preface</hi> is highly worthy to be read, and judiciouſly conſidered, eſpecially at <hi>this Time.</hi>
